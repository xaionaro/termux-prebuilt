21.5.3 HTML Generated for EPUB
------------------------------

The HTML generated for EPUB is XHTML conformant, UTF-8 encoded, and
formatted without the usual HTML navigation headers and footers.  Most
of these features are enabled with customization variables, such as
‘USE_XML_SYNTAX’ or ‘OUTPUT_FILE_NAME_ENCODING’.  Some features of
printed output are used in EPUB. In particular, the Top node does not
appear in the EPUB output, while a title page is generated.  This is
obtained by setting ‘NO_TOP_NODE_OUTPUT’.

   The ‘OUTFILE’ and ‘SUBDIR’ customization variables values correspond
initially to the EPUB directory container and/or the EPUB output file
(*note EPUB Output File and Directory::).  These customization variables
values are undefined or reset to the locations in the container
directory where the XHTML files are output for the HTML generation.  It
is mentioned here because resetting customization variables is unusual;
however, the variables reset are used internally for the conversion, and
should not interact with any customization set by the user.

   *Note HTML Customization Variables::.

21.6 Code Examples Syntax Highlighting in HTML
==============================================

     warning: Source highlighting is experimental, feedback is welcomed.

   Support for source code syntax highlighting is available in
‘texi2any’ for the HTML output, with the help of external software.
This feature is turned on by setting ‘HIGHLIGHT_SYNTAX’.  Source code
highlighting is set up for ‘@example’ blocks.  The language specified
for syntax highlighting is the first argument on the ‘@example’ line
(*note @example::), or ‘HIGHLIGHT_SYNTAX_DEFAULT_LANGUAGE’ if set and
there is no first argument.

   The ‘HIGHLIGHT_SYNTAX’ value determines the command used for
highlighting:
‘highlight’
     Use ‘highlight’ from
     <http://www.andre-simon.de/doku/highlight/en/highlight.php>;
‘pygments’
     Use ‘pygmentize’ from <https://pygments.org/>;
‘anything else’
     Use ‘source-highlight’ (*note (source-highlight)::).

   *Note Other Customization Variables::.

21.7 HTML Cross-references
==========================

Cross-references between Texinfo manuals in HTML format become standard
HTML ‘<a>’ links.  This section describes the algorithm used, so that
Texinfo can cooperate with other programs, such as ‘texi2html’, by
writing mutually compatible HTML files.

   This algorithm may or may not be used for links _within_ HTML output
for a Texinfo file.  Since no issues of compatibility arise in such
cases, we do not need to specify this.

   We try to support references to such "external" manuals in both
monolithic and split forms.  A “monolithic” (mono) manual is entirely
contained in one file, and a “split” manual has a file for each node.
(*Note HTML Splitting::.)

   The algorithm was primarily devised by Patrice Dumas in 2003-04.

21.7.1 HTML Cross-reference Link Basics
---------------------------------------

For our purposes, an HTML link consists of four components: a host name,
a directory part, a file part, and a target part.  We always assume the
‘http’ protocol.  For example:

     http://HOST/DIR/FILE.html#TARGET

   The information to construct a link comes from the node name and
manual name in the cross-reference command in the Texinfo source (*note
Cross References::), and from “external information” (*note HTML Xref
Configuration::).

   We now consider each part in turn.

   The HOST is hardwired to be the local host.  This could either be the
literal string ‘localhost’, or, according to the rules for HTML links,
the ‘http://localhost/’ could be omitted entirely.

   The DIR and FILE parts are more complicated, and depend on the
relative split/mono nature of both the manual being processed and the
manual that the cross-reference refers to.  The underlying idea is that
there is one directory for Texinfo manuals in HTML, and a given MANUAL
is either available as a monolithic file ‘MANUAL.html’, or a split
subdirectory ‘MANUAL_html/*.html’.  Here are the cases:

   • If the present manual is split, and the referent manual is also
     split, the directory is ‘../REFERENT_html/’ and the file is the
     expanded node name (described later).

   • If the present manual is split, and the referent manual is mono,
     the directory is ‘../’ and the file is ‘REFERENT.html’.

   • If the present manual is mono, and the referent manual is split,
     the directory is ‘REFERENT_html/’ and the file is the expanded node
     name.

   • If the present manual is mono, and the referent manual is also
     mono, the directory is ‘./’ (or just the empty string), and the
     file is ‘REFERENT.html’.

   Another rule, that only holds for file names, is that base file names
are truncated to 245 characters, to allow for an extension to be
appended and still comply with the 255-character limit which is common
to many filesystems.  Although technically this can be changed with the
‘BASEFILENAME_LENGTH’ customization variable (*note Other Customization
Variables::), doing so would make cross-manual references to such nodes
invalid.

   Any directory part in the file name argument of the source cross
reference command is ignored.  Thus, ‘@xref{,,,../foo}’ and
‘@xref{,,,foo}’ both use ‘foo’ as the manual name.  This is because any
such attempted hardwiring of the directory is very unlikely to be useful
for all the output formats that use the manual name.

   Finally, the TARGET part is always the expanded node name.

   Whether the present manual is split or mono is determined by user
option; ‘texi2any’ defaults to split, with the ‘--no-split’ option
overriding this.

   Whether the referent manual is split or mono, however, is another bit
of the external information (*note HTML Xref Configuration::).  By
default, ‘texi2any’ uses the same form of the referent manual as the
present manual.

   Thus, there can be a mismatch between the format of the referent
manual that the generating software assumes, and the format it's
actually present in.  *Note HTML Xref Mismatch::.

21.7.2 HTML Cross-reference Node Name Expansion
-----------------------------------------------

As mentioned in the previous section, the key part of the HTML cross
reference algorithm is the conversion of node names in the Texinfo
source into strings suitable for XHTML identifiers and file names.  The
restrictions are similar for each: plain ASCII letters, numbers, and the
‘-’ and ‘_’ characters are all that can be used.  (Although HTML anchors
can contain most characters, XHTML is more restrictive.)

   Cross-references in Texinfo can refer either to nodes, anchors (*note
@anchor::) or float labels (*note @float::).  However, anchors and float
labels are treated identically to nodes in this context, so we'll
continue to say "node" names for simplicity.

   A special exception: the Top node (*note The Top Node::) is always
mapped to the file ‘index.html’, to match web server software.  However,
the HTML _target_ is ‘Top’.  Thus (in the split case):

     @xref{Top,,, emacs, The GNU Emacs Manual}.
     ⇒ <a href="../emacs_html/index.html#Top">

  1. The standard ASCII letters (a-z and A-Z) are not modified.  All
     other characters may be changed as specified below.

  2. The standard ASCII numbers (0-9) are not modified except when a
     number is the first character of the node name.  In that case, see
     below.

  3. Multiple consecutive space, tab and newline characters are
     transformed into just one space.

  4. Leading and trailing spaces are removed.

  5. After the above has been applied, each remaining space character is
     converted into a ‘-’ character.

  6. Other ASCII 7-bit characters are transformed into ‘_00XX’, where XX
     is the ASCII character code in (lowercase) hexadecimal.  This
     includes ‘_’, which is mapped to ‘_005f’.

  7. If the node name does not begin with a letter, the literal string
     ‘g_t’ is prefixed to the result.  (Due to the rules above, that
     string can never occur otherwise; it is an arbitrary choice,
     standing for "GNU Texinfo".)  This is necessary because XHTML
     requires that identifiers begin with a letter.

   For example:

     @node A  node --- with _'%
     ⇒ A-node-_002d_002d_002d-with-_005f_0027_0025

   Example translations of common characters:

   • ‘_’ ⇒ ‘_005f’
   • ‘-’ ⇒ ‘_002d’
   • ‘A node’ ⇒ ‘A-node’

   On case-folding computer systems, nodes differing only by case will
be mapped to the same file.  In particular, as mentioned above, Top
always maps to the file ‘index.html’.  Thus, on a case-folding system,
Top and a node named 'Index' will both be written to ‘index.html’.
Fortunately, the targets serve to distinguish these cases, since HTML
target names are always case-sensitive, independent of operating system.

21.7.3 HTML Cross-reference Command Expansion
---------------------------------------------

Node names may contain @-commands (*note Node Line Requirements::).
This section describes how they are handled.

   First, comments are removed.

   Next, any ‘@value’ commands (*note @set @value::) and macro
invocations (*note Invoking Macros::) are fully expanded.

   Then, for the following commands, the command name and braces are
removed, and the text of the argument is recursively transformed:

     @asis @b @cite @code @command @dfn @dmn @dotless
     @emph @env @file @i @indicateurl @kbd @key
     @samp @sansserif @sc @slanted @strong @sub @sup
     @t @U @var @verb @w

   In addition, the following commands are replaced by constant text, as
shown below.  If any of these commands have non-empty arguments, as in
‘@TeX{bad}’, it is an error, and the result is unspecified.  In this
table, '(space)' means a space character and '(nothing)' means the empty
string.  The notation 'U+HHHH' means Unicode code point HHHH (in hex, as
usual).

   There are further transformations of many of these expansions to
yield the final file or other target name, such as space characters to
‘-’, etc., according to the other rules.

‘@(newline)’           (space)
‘@(space)’             (space)
‘@(tab)’               (space)
‘@!’                   ‘!’
‘@*’                   (space)
‘@-’                   (nothing)
‘@.’                   ‘.’
‘@:’                   (nothing)
‘@?’                   ‘?’
‘@@’                   ‘@’
‘@{’                   ‘{’
‘@}’                   ‘}’
‘@LaTeX’               ‘LaTeX’
‘@TeX’                 ‘TeX’
‘@arrow’               U+2192
‘@bullet’              U+2022
‘@comma’               ‘,’
‘@copyright’           U+00A9
‘@dots’                U+2026
‘@enddots’             ‘...’
‘@equiv’               U+2261
‘@error’               ‘error-->’
‘@euro’                U+20AC
‘@exclamdown’          U+00A1
‘@expansion’           U+21A6
‘@geq’                 U+2265
‘@leq’                 U+2264
‘@minus’               U+2212
‘@ordf’                U+00AA
‘@ordm’                U+00BA
‘@point’               U+22C6
‘@pounds’              U+00A3
‘@print’               U+22A3
‘@questiondown’        U+00BF
‘@registeredsymbol’    U+00AE
‘@result’              U+21D2
‘@textdegree’          U+00B0
‘@tie’                 (space)

   Quotation mark @-commands (‘@quotedblright{}’ and the like), are
likewise replaced by their Unicode values.  Normal quotation
_characters_ (e.g., ASCII ' and ') are not altered.  *Note Inserting
Quotation Marks::.

   Any ‘@acronym’, ‘@abbr’, ‘@email’, and ‘@image’ commands are replaced
by their first argument.  (For these commands, all subsequent arguments
are optional, and ignored here.)  *Note @acronym::, and *note @email::,
and *note Images::.

   Accents are handled according to the next section.

   Any other command is an error, and the result is unspecified.

21.7.4 HTML Cross-reference 8-bit Character Expansion
-----------------------------------------------------

Usually, characters other than plain 7-bit ASCII are transformed into
the corresponding Unicode code point(s) in Normalization Form C, which
uses precomposed characters where available.  (This is the normalization
form recommended by the W3C and other bodies.)  This holds when that
code point is ‘0xffff’ or less, as it almost always is.

   These will then be further transformed by the rules above into the
string ‘_HHHH’, where HHHH is the code point in hex.

   For example, combining this rule and the previous section:

     @node @b{A} @TeX{} @u{B} @point{}@enddots{}
     ⇒ A-TeX-B_0306-_22C6_002e_002e_002e

   Notice: 1) ‘@enddots’ expands to three periods which in turn expands
to three ‘_002e’'s; 2) ‘@u{B}’ is a 'B' with a breve accent, which does
not exist as a pre-accented Unicode character, therefore expands to
‘B_0306’ (B with combining breve).

   When the Unicode code point is above ‘0xffff’, the transformation is
‘__XXXXXX’, that is, two leading underscores followed by six hex digits.
Since Unicode has declared that their highest code point is ‘0x10ffff’,
this is sufficient.  (We felt it was better to define this extra escape
than to always use six hex digits, since the first two would nearly
always be zeros.)

   This method works fine if the node name consists mostly of ASCII
characters and contains only few 8-bit ones.  But if the document is
written in a language whose script is not based on the Latin alphabet
(for example, Ukrainian), it will create file names consisting almost
entirely of ‘_XXXX’ notations, which is inconvenient and all but
unreadable.  To handle such cases, ‘texi2any’ offers the
‘--transliterate-file-names’ command line option.  This option enables
“transliteration” of node names into ASCII characters for the purposes
of file name creation and referencing.  The transliteration is based on
phonetic principles, which makes the generated file names more easily
understandable.

   For the definition of Unicode Normalization Form C, see Unicode
report UAX#15, <http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr15/>.  Many related
documents and implementations are available elsewhere on the web.

21.7.5 HTML Cross-reference Mismatch
------------------------------------

As mentioned earlier (*note HTML Xref Link Basics::), the generating
software may need to guess whether a given manual being cross-referenced
is available in split or monolithic form--and, inevitably, it might
guess wrong.  However, when the _referent_ manual is generated, it is
possible to handle at least some mismatches.

   In the case where we assume the referent is split, but it is actually
available in mono, the only recourse would be to generate a
‘manual_html/’ subdirectory full of HTML files which redirect back to
the monolithic ‘manual.html’.  Since this is essentially the same as a
split manual in the first place, it's not very appealing.

   On the other hand, in the case where we assume the referent is mono,
but it is actually available in split, it is possible to use JavaScript
to redirect from the putatively monolithic ‘manual.html’ to the
different ‘manual_html/node.html’ files.  Here's an example:

     function redirect() {
       switch (location.hash) {
         case "#Node1":
           location.replace("manual_html/Node1.html#Node1"); break;
         case "#Node2" :
           location.replace("manual_html/Node2.html#Node2"); break;
         ...
         default:;
       }
     }

   Then, in the ‘<body>’ tag of ‘manual.html’:

     <body onLoad="redirect();">

   Once again, this is something the software which generated the
_referent_ manual has to do in advance, it's not something the software
generating the cross-reference in the present manual can control.

21.7.6 HTML Cross-reference Configuration: ‘htmlxref.cnf’
---------------------------------------------------------

‘texi2any’ reads a file named ‘htmlxref.cnf’ to gather information for
cross-references to other manuals in HTML output.  It is looked for in
the following directories:

‘./’
     (the current directory)

‘./.texinfo/’
     (under the current directory)

‘~/.texinfo/’
     (where ‘~’ is the current user's home directory)

‘SYSCONFDIR/texinfo/’
     (where SYSCONFDIR is the system configuration directory specified
     at compile-time, e.g., ‘/usr/local/etc’)

‘DATADIR/texinfo/’
     (likewise specified at compile time, e.g., ‘/usr/local/share’)

   All files found are used, with earlier entries overriding later ones.
The Texinfo distribution includes a default file which handles many GNU
manuals; it is installed in the last of the above directories, i.e.,
‘DATADIR/texinfo/htmlxref.cnf’.

   The ‘HTMLXREF_MODE’ customization variable can be set to modify how
the files are found.  For instance, if set to ‘none’, no external
information is used.  ‘HTMLXREF_FILE’ sets the file name to something
else than ‘htmlxref.cnf’.  *note HTML Customization Variables::.

   The file is line-oriented.  Lines consisting only of whitespace are
ignored.  Comments are indicated with a ‘#’ at the beginning of a line,
optionally preceded by whitespace.  Since ‘#’ can occur in URLs (like
almost any character), it does not otherwise start a comment.

   Each non-blank non-comment line must be either a “variable
assignment” or “manual information”.

   A variable assignment line looks like this:

     VARNAME = VARVALUE

   Whitespace around the ‘=’ is optional and ignored.  The VARNAME
should consist of letters; case is significant.  The VARVALUE is an
arbitrary string, continuing to the end of the line.  Variables are then
referenced with ‘${VARNAME}’; variable references can occur in the
VARVALUE.

   A manual information line looks like this:

     MANUAL KEYWORD URLPREFIX

with MANUAL the short identifier for a manual, KEYWORD being one of:
‘mono’, ‘node’, ‘section’, ‘chapter’, and URLPREFIX described below.
Variable references can occur only in the URLPREFIX.  For example (used
in the canonical ‘htmlxref.cnf’):

     G = http://www.gnu.org
     GS = ${G}/software
     hello mono    ${GS}/hello/manual/hello.html
     hello chapter ${GS}/hello/manual/html_chapter/
     hello section ${GS}/hello/manual/html_section/
     hello node    ${GS}/hello/manual/html_node/

   If the keyword is ‘mono’, URLPREFIX gives the host, directory, and
file name for MANUAL as one monolithic file.

   If the keyword is ‘node’, ‘section’, or ‘chapter’, URLPREFIX gives
the host and directory for MANUAL split into nodes, sections, or
chapters, respectively.

   When available, ‘texi2any’ will use the "corresponding" value for
cross-references between manuals.  That is, when generating monolithic
output (‘--no-split’), the ‘mono’ URL will be used, when generating
output that is split by node, the ‘node’ URL will be used, etc.
However, if a manual is not available in that form, anything that is
available can be used.  Here is the search order for each style:

     node    ⇒ node,    section, chapter, mono
     section ⇒ section, chapter, node,    mono
     chapter ⇒ chapter, section, node,    mono
     mono    ⇒ mono,    chapter, section, node

   These section- and chapter-level cross-manual references can succeed
only when the target manual was created using ‘--node-files’; this is
the default for split output.

   If you have additions or corrections to the ‘htmlxref.cnf’
distributed with Texinfo, please email <bug-texinfo@gnu.org> as usual.
You can get the latest version from
<http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/texinfo/htmlxref.cnf>.

Here are the details of @-commands: information about their syntax, a
list of commands, and information about where commands can appear.

File: texinfo.info,  Node: Command Syntax,  Next: Command List,  Up: @-Command Details

A.1 @-Command Syntax
====================

Texinfo has the following types of @-command:

1. Brace commands
     These commands start with @ followed by a letter or a word,
     followed by an argument within braces.  For example, the command
     ‘@dfn’ indicates the introductory or defining use of a term; it is
     used as follows: ‘In Texinfo, @@-commands are @dfn{mark-up}
     commands.’

2. Line commands
     These commands occupy an entire line.  The line starts with @,
     followed by the name of the command (a word); for example,
     ‘@center’ or ‘@cindex’.  If no argument is needed, the word is
     followed by the end of the line.  If there is an argument, it is
     separated from the command name by a space.  Braces are not used.

3. Block commands
     These commands are written at the start of a line, with general
     text on following lines, terminated by a matching ‘@end’ command on
     a line of its own.  For example, ‘@example’, then the lines of a
     coding example, then ‘@end example’.  Some of these block commands
     take arguments as line commands do; for example, ‘@enumerate A’
     opening an environment terminated by ‘@end enumerate’.  Here ‘A’ is
     the argument.

4. Symbol insertion commands with no arguments
     These commands start with @ followed by a word followed by a left
     and right- brace.  These commands insert special symbols in the
     document; they do not take arguments.  Some examples: ‘@dots{}’ ⇒
     ‘...’, ‘@equiv{}’ ⇒ ‘≡’, ‘@TeX{}’ ⇒ 'TeX', and ‘@bullet{}’ ⇒ ‘•’.

5. Non-alphabetic commands
     The names of commands in all of the above categories consist of
     alphabetic characters, almost entirely in lower-case.  Unlike
     those, the non-alphabetic commands consist of an @ followed by a
     punctuation mark or other character that is not part of the Latin
     alphabet.  Non-alphabetic commands are almost always part of text
     within a paragraph.  The non-alphabetic commands include ‘@@’,
     ‘@{’, ‘@}’, ‘@.’, ‘@SPACE’, and most of the accent commands.

6. Miscellaneous commands
     There are a handful of commands that don't fit into any of the
     above categories; for example, the obsolete command ‘@refill’,
     which is always used at the end of a paragraph immediately
     following the final period or other punctuation character.
     ‘@refill’ takes no argument and does not require braces.  Likewise,
     ‘@tab’ used in a ‘@multitable’ block does not take arguments, and
     is not followed by braces.

   Thus, the alphabetic commands fall into classes that have different
argument syntaxes.  You cannot tell to which class a command belongs by
the appearance of its name, but you can tell by the command's meaning:
if the command stands for a glyph, it is in class 4 and does not require
an argument; if it makes sense to use the command among other text as
part of a paragraph, the command is in class 1 and must be followed by
an argument in braces.  The non-alphabetic commands, such as ‘@:’, are
exceptions to the rule; they do not need braces.

   The purpose of having different syntax for commands is to make
Texinfo files easier to read, and also to help the GNU Emacs paragraph
and filling commands work properly.

implementations.

   By “general text” below, we mean anything except sectioning and other
such outer-level document commands, such as ‘@section’, ‘@node’, and
‘@setfilename’.

   ‘@c’, ‘@comment’ and ‘@if ... @end if’ conditional commands may
appear anywhere (except the conditionals must still be on lines by
themselves).  ‘@caption’ and ‘@shortcaption’ may only appear in ‘@float’
but may contain general text.  ‘@footnote’ content likewise.

   @-commands with braces marking text (such as ‘@strong’, ‘@sc’,
‘@asis’) may contain raw formatter commands such as ‘@html’ but no other
block commands (other commands terminated by ‘@end’) and may not be
split across paragraphs, but may otherwise contain general text.

   In addition to the block command restriction, on ‘@center’, ‘@exdent’
and ‘@item’ in ‘@table’ lines, @-commands that makes only sense in a
paragraph are not accepted, such as ‘@indent’.

   In addition to the above, sectioning commands cannot contain
‘@anchor’, ‘@footnote’ or ‘@verb’.

   In addition to the above, remaining commands (‘@node’, ‘@anchor’,
‘@printindex’, ‘@ref’, ‘@math’, ‘@cindex’, ‘@url’, ‘@image’, and so on)
cannot contain cross-reference commands (‘@ref’, ‘@xref’, ‘@pxref’ and
‘@inforef’).

   For precise and complete information, we suggest looking into the
test suite in the sources, which exhaustively tries combinations.

A.4 Obsolete @-Commands
=======================

Here are Texinfo @-commands which are obsolete or have been removed
completely.  This section is for historical purposes.

‘@refill’
     This command used to refill and indent the paragraph after all the
     other processing has been done.  It is no longer needed, since all
     formatters now automatically refill as needed, but you may still
     see it in the source to some manuals, as it does no harm.

‘@setcontentsaftertitlepage’
     In the past, the contents commands were sometimes placed at the end
     of the file, after any indices and just before the ‘@bye’, but we
     no longer recommend this.  This command could be used by a user
     printing a manual, to force the contents to be printed after the
     title page (after the ‘@end titlepage’ line) even if the
     ‘@contents’ command was at the end of the manual.

‘@setshortcontentsaftertitlepage’
     This placed the short table of contents after the ‘@end titlepage’
     command even if the ‘@shortcontents’ command was at the end.

Appendix B Tips and Hints
*************************

Here are some tips for writing Texinfo documentation:

   • Write in the present tense, not in the past or the future.

   • Write actively!  For example, write "We recommend that ..." rather
     than "It is recommended that ...".

   • Use 70 or 72 as your fill column.  Longer lines are hard to read.

   • Include a copyright notice and copying permissions.

   • Design your manual so that it can be read sequentially, as far as
     possible.  People tire of flipping back and forth to find
     information that should be presented to them as they need it.

Index, Index, Index!
....................

Write many index entries, in different ways.  Readers like indices; they
are helpful and convenient.

   Although it is easiest to write index entries as you write the body
of the text, some people prefer to write entries afterwards.  In either
case, write an entry before the paragraph to which it applies.  This
way, an index entry points to the first page of a paragraph that is
split across pages.

   Here are more index-related hints we have found valuable:

   • Write each index entry differently, so each entry refers to a
     different place in the document.

   • Write index entries only where a topic is discussed significantly.
     For example, it is not useful to index "debugging information" in a
     chapter on reporting bugs.  Someone who wants to know about
     debugging information will certainly not find it in that chapter.

   • Consistently capitalize the first word of every concept index
     entry, or else consistently use lowercase.  Terse entries often
     call for lowercase; longer entries for capitalization.  Whichever
     case convention you use, please use one or the other consistently!
     Mixing the two styles looks bad.

   • Always capitalize or use uppercase for those words in an index for
     which this is proper, such as names of countries or acronyms.
     Always use the appropriate case for case-sensitive names, such as
     those in C or Lisp.

   • Write the indexing commands that refer to a whole section
     immediately after the section command, and write the indexing
     commands that refer to a paragraph before that paragraph.

     In the example that follows, a blank line comes after the index
     entry for "Leaping":

          @section The Dog and the Fox
          @cindex Jumping, in general
          @cindex Leaping

          @cindex Dog, lazy, jumped over
          @cindex Lazy dog jumped over
          @cindex Fox, jumps over dog
          @cindex Quick fox jumps over dog
          The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.

     (Note that the example shows entries for the same concept that are
     written in different ways--‘Lazy dog’, and ‘Dog, lazy’--so readers
     can look up the concept in different ways.)

Blank Lines
...........

   • Insert a blank line between a sectioning command and the first
     following sentence or paragraph, or between the indexing commands
     associated with the sectioning command and the first following
     sentence or paragraph, as shown in the tip on indexing.  It makes
     the source easier to read.

   • Always insert a blank line before a ‘@table’ command and after an
     ‘@end table’ command; but never insert a blank line after an
     ‘@table’ command.

     For example,

          Types of fox:

          @table @samp
          @item Quick
          Jump over lazy dogs.

          @item Brown
          Also jump over lazy dogs.
          @end table

          @noindent
          On the other hand, ...

     Insert blank lines before and after ‘@itemize’ ... ‘@end itemize’
     and ‘@enumerate’ ... ‘@end enumerate’ in the same way.

Complete Phrases
................

Complete phrases are easier to read than ...

   • Write entries in an itemized list as complete sentences; or at
     least, as complete phrases.  Incomplete expressions ... awkward ...
     like this.

   • Write the prefatory sentence or phrase for a multi-item list or
     table as a complete expression.  Do not write "You can set:";
     instead, write "You can set these variables:".  The former
     expression sounds cut off.

Editions, Dates and Versions
............................

Include edition numbers, version numbers, and dates in the ‘@copying’
text (for people reading the Texinfo file, and for the legal copyright
in the output files).  Then use ‘@insertcopying’ in the ‘@titlepage’
section for people reading the printed output (*note Short Sample::).

   It is easiest to handle such version information using ‘@set’ and
‘@value’.  *Note @value Example::, and *note GNU Sample Texts::.

Definition Commands
...................

Definition commands are ‘@deffn’, ‘@defun’, ‘@defmac’, and the like, and
enable you to write descriptions in a uniform format.

   • Write just one definition command for each entity you define with a
     definition command.  The automatic indexing feature creates an
     index entry that leads the reader to the definition.

   • Use ‘@table’ ... ‘@end table’ in an appendix that contains a
     summary of functions, not ‘@deffn’ or other definition commands.

Capitalization
..............

   • Capitalize "Texinfo"; it is a name.  Do not write the ‘x’ or ‘i’ in
     uppercase.

   • Capitalize "Info"; it is a name.

   • Write TeX using the ‘@TeX{}’ command.  Note the uppercase ‘T’ and
     ‘X’.  This command causes the formatters to typeset the name
     according to the wishes of Donald Knuth, who wrote TeX.  (Likewise
     ‘@LaTeX{}’ for LaTeX.)

Spaces
......

Do not use spaces to format a Texinfo file, except inside of ‘@example’
... ‘@end example’ and other literal environments and commands.

   For example, TeX fills the following:

        @kbd{C-x v}
        @kbd{M-x vc-next-action}
           Perform the next logical operation
           on the version-controlled file
           corresponding to the current buffer.

so it looks like this:

     'C-x v' 'M-x vc-next-action' Perform the next logical operation on
     the version-controlled file corresponding to the current buffer.

In this case, the text should be formatted with ‘@table’, ‘@item’, and
‘@itemx’, to create a table.

@code, @samp, @var, and ‘---’
.............................

   • Use ‘@code’ around Lisp symbols, including command names.  For
     example,

          The main function is @code{vc-next-action}, ...

   • Avoid putting letters such as ‘s’ immediately after an ‘@code’.
     Such letters look bad.

   • Use ‘@var’ around meta-variables.  Do not write angle brackets
     around them.

   • Use three hyphens in a row, ‘---’, to indicate a long dash.  The
     Info formatter reduces three hyphens to two; a long dash is typeset
     in other output formats.

Periods Outside of Quotes
.........................

Place periods and other punctuation marks _outside_ of quotations,
unless the punctuation is part of the quotation.  This practice goes
against some publishing conventions in the United States, but enables
the reader to distinguish between the contents of the quotation and the
whole passage.

   For example, you should write the following sentence with the period
outside the end quotation marks:

     Evidently, ‘au’ is an abbreviation for ``author''.

since ‘au’ does _not_ serve as an abbreviation for ‘author.’ (with a
period following the word).

Introducing New Terms
.....................

   • Introduce new terms so that a reader who does not know them can
     understand them from context; or write a definition for the term.

     For example, in the following, the terms "check in", "register" and
     "delta" are all appearing for the first time; the example sentence
     should be rewritten so they are understandable.

          The major function assists you in checking in a file to your
          version control system and registering successive sets of
          changes to it as deltas.

   • Use the ‘@dfn’ command around a word being introduced, to indicate
     that the reader should not expect to know the meaning already, and
     should expect to learn the meaning from this passage.

Program Invocation Nodes
........................

You can invoke programs such as Emacs, GCC, and ‘gawk’ from a shell.
The documentation for each program should contain a section that
describes this.  Unfortunately, if the node names and titles for these
sections are all different, they are difficult for users to find.

   So, there is a convention to name such sections with a phrase
beginning with the word 'Invoking', as in 'Invoking Emacs'; this way,
users can find the section easily.

ANSI C Syntax
.............

When you use ‘@example’ to describe a C function's calling conventions,
use the ANSI C syntax, like this:

     void dld_init (char *@var{path});

And in the subsequent discussion, refer to the argument values by
writing the same argument names, again highlighted with ‘@var’.

   Avoid the obsolete style that looks like this:

     #include <dld.h>

     dld_init (path)
       char *path;

   Also, it is best to avoid writing ‘#include’ above the declaration
just to indicate that the function is declared in a header file.  The
practice may give the misimpression that the ‘#include’ belongs near the
declaration of the function.  Either state explicitly which header file
holds the declaration or, better yet, name the header file used for a
group of functions at the beginning of the section that describes the
functions.

Node Length
...........

Keep nodes (sections) to a reasonable length, whatever reasonable might
be in the given context.  Don't hesitate to break up long nodes into
subnodes and have an extensive tree structure; that's what it's there
for.  Many times, readers will probably try to find a single specific
point in the manual, using search, indexing, or just plain guessing,
rather than reading the whole thing from beginning to end.

   You can use the ‘texi-elements-by-size’ utility to see a list of all
nodes (or sections) in the document, sorted by size (either lines or
words), to find candidates for splitting.  It's in the ‘util/’
subdirectory of the Texinfo sources.

Bad Examples
............

Here are several examples of bad writing to avoid:

   In this example, say, " ... you must ‘@dfn’{check in} the new
version."  That flows better.

     When you are done editing the file, you must perform a ‘@dfn’{check
     in}.

   In the following example, say, "... makes a unified interface such as
VC mode possible."

     SCCS, RCS and other version-control systems all perform similar
     functions in broadly similar ways (it is this resemblance which
     makes a unified control mode like this possible).

   And in this example, you should specify what 'it' refers to:

     If you are working with other people, it assists in coordinating
     everyone's changes so they do not step on each other.

And Finally ...
...............

   • Pronounce TeX as if the ‘X’ were a Greek 'chi', as the last sound
     in the name 'Bach'.  But pronounce Texinfo as in 'speck':
     "teckinfo".

   • Write notes for yourself at the very end of a Texinfo file after
     the ‘@bye’.  None of the processors process text after the ‘@bye’;
     it is as if the text were within ‘@ignore’ ... ‘@end ignore’.

C.1 GNU Sample Texts
====================

Following is a sample Texinfo document with the full texts that should
be used (adapted as necessary) in GNU manuals.

   As well as the legal texts, it also serves as a practical example of
how many elements in a GNU system can affect the manual.  If you're not
familiar with all these different elements, don't worry.  They're not
required and a perfectly good manual can be written without them.
They're included here nonetheless because many manuals do (or could)
benefit from them.

   *Note Short Sample::, for a minimal example of a Texinfo file.

   Here are some notes on the example:

   • The ‘version.texi’ in the ‘@include’ command is maintained
     automatically by Automake (*note (automake)Texinfo::).  It sets the
     ‘VERSION’, ‘UPDATED’ and ‘UPDATED-MONTH’ values used elsewhere.  If
     your distribution doesn't use Automake, but you do use Emacs, you
     may find the ‘time-stamp.el’ package helpful (*note (emacs)Time
     Stamps::).

   • The ‘@syncodeindex’ command reflects the recommendation to use only
     one index where possible, to make it easier for readers to look up
     index entries.

   • The ‘@dircategory’ specify a category for the manual.  It is used
     for constructing the Info directory.  *Note Directory Category::,
     which includes a variety of recommended category names.  *Note
     Installing Dir Entries::.

   • The 'Invoking' node is a GNU standard to help users find the basic
     information about command-line usage of a given program.  *Note
     (standards)Manual Structure Details::.

   • This sample shows how to includes the FDL in a manual using the
     ‘@include’ command.  The ‘fdl.texi’ file is available in the
     Texinfo and other GNU source distributions.  It is also available
     on the GNU website (at <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/fdl-1.3.html>)
     along with guidance for using it.

   • If the FSF is not the copyright holder, then use the appropriate
     name.

   • For documents that express your personal views, feelings or
     experiences, it is more appropriate to use a license permitting
     only verbatim copying, rather than the FDL.  *Note Verbatim Copying
     License::.

   Here is the sample document:

C.2 Verbatim Copying License
============================

For software manuals and other documentation, it is critical to use a
license permitting free redistribution and updating, so that when a free
program is changed, the documentation can be updated as well.

   On the other hand, for documents that express your personal views,
feelings or experiences, it is more appropriate to use a license
permitting only verbatim copying.

   Here is a sample text for such a license permitting verbatim copying
only.  This is just the license text itself.  For a complete sample
document, see the previous sections.

@copying
This document is a sample for allowing verbatim copying only.

C.3 All-permissive Copying License
==================================

For software manuals and other documentation, it is important to use a
license permitting free redistribution and updating, so that when a free
program is changed, the documentation can be updated as well.

   On the other hand, for small supporting files, short manuals (under
300 lines long) and rough documentation (README files, INSTALL files,
etc.), the full FDL would be overkill.  They can use a simple
all-permissive license.

   Here is a sample text for such an all-permissive license.  This is
just the license text itself.  For a complete sample document, see the
previous sections.

Appendix D Using Texinfo Mode
*****************************

You may edit a Texinfo file with any text editor you choose.  A Texinfo
file is no different from any other ASCII file.  However, GNU Emacs

commands and tools to help ease your work.

D.1 Texinfo Mode Overview
=========================

Texinfo mode provides special features for working with Texinfo files.
You can:

   • Insert frequently used @-commands.

   • Automatically create ‘@node’ lines.

   • Show the structure of a Texinfo source file.

   • Automatically create or update the 'Next', 'Previous', and 'Up'
     pointers of a node.

   • Automatically create or update menus.

   • Automatically create a master menu.

   • Format a part or all of a file for Info.

   • Typeset and print part or all of a file.

   Perhaps the two most helpful features are those for inserting
frequently used @-commands and for creating node pointers and menus.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: Emacs Editing,  Next: Inserting,  Prev: Texinfo Mode Overview,  Up: Texinfo Mode

D.2 The Usual GNU Emacs Editing Commands
========================================

In most cases, the usual Text mode commands work the same in Texinfo
mode as they do in Text mode.  Texinfo mode adds new editing commands
and tools to GNU Emacs' general purpose editing features.  The major
difference concerns filling.  In Texinfo mode, the paragraph separation
variable and syntax table are redefined so that Texinfo commands that
should be on lines of their own are not inadvertently included in
paragraphs.  Thus, the ‘M-q’ (‘fill-paragraph’) command will refill a
paragraph but not mix an indexing command on a line adjacent to it into
the paragraph.

   In addition, Texinfo mode sets the ‘page-delimiter’ variable to the
value of ‘texinfo-chapter-level-regexp’; by default, this is a regular
expression matching the commands for chapters and their equivalents,
such as appendices.  With this value for the page delimiter, you can
jump from chapter title to chapter title with the ‘C-x ]’
(‘forward-page’) and ‘C-x [’ (‘backward-page’) commands and narrow to a
chapter with the ‘C-x n p’ (‘narrow-to-page’) command.  (*Note
(emacs)Pages::, for details about the page commands.)

   GNU Emacs automatically enters Texinfo mode when you visit a file
with a ‘.texinfo’, ‘.texi’ or ‘.txi’ extension.  Also, Emacs switches to
Texinfo mode when you visit a file that has ‘-*-texinfo-*-’ in its first
line.  If ever you are in another mode and wish to switch to Texinfo
mode, type ‘M-x texinfo-mode’.

   Like all other Emacs features, you can customize or enhance Texinfo
mode as you wish.  In particular, the keybindings are very easy to
change.  The keybindings described here are the default or standard
ones.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: Inserting,  Next: Showing the Structure,  Prev: Emacs Editing,  Up: Texinfo Mode

D.3 Inserting Frequently Used Commands
======================================

Texinfo mode provides commands to insert various frequently used
@-commands into the buffer.  You can use these commands to save
keystrokes.

   The insert commands are invoked by typing ‘C-c’ twice and then the
first letter of the @-command:

‘C-c C-c c’
‘M-x texinfo-insert-@code’
     Insert ‘@code{}’ and put the cursor between the braces.

‘C-c C-c d’
‘M-x texinfo-insert-@dfn’
     Insert ‘@dfn{}’ and put the cursor between the braces.

‘C-c C-c e’
‘M-x texinfo-insert-@end’
     Insert ‘@end’ and attempt to insert the correct following word,
     such as ‘example’ or ‘table’.  (This command does not handle nested
     lists correctly, but inserts the word appropriate to the
     immediately preceding list.)

‘C-c C-c i’
‘M-x texinfo-insert-@item’
     Insert ‘@item’ and put the cursor at the beginning of the next
     line.

‘C-c C-c k’
‘M-x texinfo-insert-@kbd’
     Insert ‘@kbd{}’ and put the cursor between the braces.

‘C-c C-c n’
‘M-x texinfo-insert-@node’
     Insert ‘@node’ and a comment line listing the sequence for the
     'Next', 'Previous', and 'Up' nodes.  Leave point after the ‘@node’.

‘C-c C-c o’
‘M-x texinfo-insert-@noindent’
     Insert ‘@noindent’ and put the cursor at the beginning of the next
     line.

‘C-c C-c r’
‘M-x texinfo-insert-dwim-@ref’
     This function and binding were added in Emacs 27.1.  Inserts one of
     ‘@pxref{}’, ‘@xref{}’, or ‘@ref{}’ based on the text around point;
     calling it near an unclosed preceding open parenthesis results in
     ‘@pxref{}’, at the beginning of a sentence or at ‘(point-min)’
     yields ‘@xref{}’, any other location (including inside a word),
     will result in ‘@ref{}’.  A numeric argument says how many words
     the braces should surround.  Puts the cursor between the braces.

‘C-c C-c s’
‘M-x texinfo-insert-@samp’
     Insert ‘@samp{}’ and put the cursor between the braces.

‘C-c C-c t’
‘M-x texinfo-insert-@table’
     Insert ‘@table’ followed by a <SPC> and leave the cursor after the
     <SPC>.

‘C-c C-c v’
‘M-x texinfo-insert-@var’
     Insert ‘@var{}’ and put the cursor between the braces.

‘C-c C-c x’
‘M-x texinfo-insert-@example’
     Insert ‘@example’ and put the cursor at the beginning of the next
     line.

‘C-c C-c {’
‘M-x texinfo-insert-braces’
     Insert ‘{}’ and put the cursor between the braces.

‘C-c }’
‘C-c ]’
‘M-x up-list’
     Move from between a pair of braces forward past the closing brace.
     Typing ‘C-c ]’ is easier than typing ‘C-c }’, which is, however,
     more mnemonic; hence the two keybindings.  (Also, you can move out
     from between braces by typing ‘C-f’.)

   To put a command such as ‘@code{...}’ around an _existing_ word,
position the cursor in front of the word and type ‘C-u 1 C-c C-c c’.
This makes it easy to edit existing plain text.  The value of the prefix
argument tells Emacs how many words following point to include between
braces--‘1’ for one word, ‘2’ for two words, and so on.  Use a negative
argument to enclose the previous word or words.  If you do not specify a
prefix argument, Emacs inserts the @-command string and positions the
cursor between the braces.  This feature works only for those @-commands
that operate on a word or words within one line, such as ‘@kbd’ and
‘@var’.

   This set of insert commands was created after analyzing the frequency
with which different @-commands are used in the ‘GNU Emacs Manual’ and
the ‘GDB Manual’.  If you wish to add your own insert commands, you can
bind a keyboard macro to a key, use abbreviations, or extend the code in
‘texinfo.el’.

   ‘C-c C-c C-d’ (‘texinfo-start-menu-description’) is an insert command
that works differently from the other insert commands.  It inserts a
node's section or chapter title in the space for the description in a
menu entry line.  (A menu entry has three parts, the entry name, the
node name, and the description.  Only the node name is required, but a
description helps explain what the node is about.  *Note The Parts of a
Menu: Menu Parts.)

   To use ‘texinfo-start-menu-description’, position point in a menu
entry line and type ‘C-c C-c C-d’.  The command looks for and copies the
title that goes with the node name, and inserts the title as a
description; it positions point at the beginning of the inserted text so
you can edit it.  The function does not insert the title if the menu
entry line already contains a description.

   This command is only an aid to writing descriptions; it does not do
the whole job.  You must edit the inserted text since a title tends to
use the same words as a node name but a useful description uses
different words.

D.4 Showing the Sectioning Structure of a File
==============================================

You can show the sectioning structure of a Texinfo file by using the
‘C-c C-s’ command (‘texinfo-show-structure’).  This command lists the
lines that begin with the @-commands for ‘@chapter’, ‘@section’, and the
like.  It constructs what amounts to a table of contents.  These lines
are displayed in another buffer called the ‘*Occur*’ buffer.  In that
buffer, you can position the cursor over one of the lines and use the
‘C-c C-c’ command (‘occur-mode-goto-occurrence’), to jump to the
corresponding spot in the Texinfo file.

‘C-c C-s’
‘M-x texinfo-show-structure’
     Show the ‘@chapter’, ‘@section’, and such lines of a Texinfo file.

‘C-c C-c’
‘M-x occur-mode-goto-occurrence’
     Go to the line in the Texinfo file corresponding to the line under
     the cursor in the ‘*Occur*’ buffer.

   If you call ‘texinfo-show-structure’ with a prefix argument by typing
‘C-u C-c C-s’, it will list not only those lines with the @-commands for
‘@chapter’, ‘@section’, and the like, but also the ‘@node’ lines.  You
can use ‘texinfo-show-structure’ with a prefix argument to check whether
the 'Next', 'Previous', and 'Up' pointers of an ‘@node’ line are
correct.

   Often, when you are working on a manual, you will be interested only
in the structure of the current chapter.  In this case, you can mark off
the region of the buffer that you are interested in by using the ‘C-x n
n’ (‘narrow-to-region’) command and ‘texinfo-show-structure’ will work
on only that region.  To see the whole buffer again, use ‘C-x n w’
(‘widen’).  (*Note (emacs)Narrowing::, for more information about the
narrowing commands.)

   In addition to providing the ‘texinfo-show-structure’ command,
Texinfo mode sets the value of the page delimiter variable to match the
chapter-level @-commands.  This enables you to use the ‘C-x ]’
(‘forward-page’) and ‘C-x [’ (‘backward-page’) commands to move forward
and backward by chapter, and to use the ‘C-x n p’ (‘narrow-to-page’)
command to narrow to a chapter.  *Note (emacs)Pages::, for more
information about the page commands.

D.4.1 Using ‘texinfo-show-structure’
------------------------------------

It is not always easy to keep track of the nodes, chapters, sections,
and subsections of a Texinfo file.  This is especially true if you are
revising or adding to a Texinfo file that someone else has written.

   In GNU Emacs, in Texinfo mode, the ‘texinfo-show-structure’ command
lists all the lines that begin with the @-commands that specify the
structure: ‘@chapter’, ‘@section’, ‘@appendix’, and so on.  With an
argument (‘C-u’ as prefix argument, if interactive), the command also
shows the ‘@node’ lines.  The ‘texinfo-show-structure’ command is bound
to ‘C-c C-s’ in Texinfo mode, by default.

   The lines are displayed in a buffer called the ‘*Occur*’ buffer,
indented by hierarchical level.  For example, here is a part of what was
produced by running ‘texinfo-show-structure’ on this manual:

     Lines matching "^@\\(chapter \\|sect\\|subs\\|subh\\|
     unnum\\|major\\|chapheading \\|heading \\|appendix\\)"
     in buffer texinfo.texi.
     ...
     4177:@chapter Nodes
     4198:    @heading Two Paths
     4231:    @section Node and Menu Illustration
     4337:    @section The @code{@@node} Command
     4393:        @subheading Choosing Node and Pointer Names
     4417:        @subsection How to Write a @code{@@node} Line
     4469:        @subsection @code{@@node} Line Tips
     ...

   This says that lines 4337, 4393, and 4417 of ‘texinfo.texi’ begin
with the ‘@section’, ‘@subheading’, and ‘@subsection’ commands
respectively.  If you move your cursor into the ‘*Occur*’ window, you
can position the cursor over one of the lines and use the ‘C-c C-c’
command (‘occur-mode-goto-occurrence’), to jump to the corresponding
spot in the Texinfo file.  *Note Using Occur: (emacs)Other Repeating
Search, for more information about ‘occur-mode-goto-occurrence’.

   The first line in the ‘*Occur*’ window describes the “regular
expression” specified by TEXINFO-HEADING-PATTERN.  This regular
expression is the pattern that ‘texinfo-show-structure’ looks for.
*Note Using Regular Expressions: (emacs)Regexps, for more information.

   When you invoke the ‘texinfo-show-structure’ command, Emacs will
display the structure of the whole buffer.  If you want to see the
structure of just a part of the buffer, of one chapter, for example, use
the ‘C-x n n’ (‘narrow-to-region’) command to mark the region.  (*Note
(emacs)Narrowing::.)  This is how the example used above was generated.
(To see the whole buffer again, use ‘C-x n w’ (‘widen’).)

   If you call ‘texinfo-show-structure’ with a prefix argument by typing
‘C-u C-c C-s’, it will list lines beginning with ‘@node’ as well as the
lines beginning with the @-sign commands for ‘@chapter’, ‘@section’, and
the like.

   You can remind yourself of the structure of a Texinfo file by looking
at the list in the ‘*Occur*’ window; and if you have mis-named a node or
left out a section, you can correct the mistake.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: Using occur,  Prev: Using texinfo-show-structure,  Up: Showing the Structure

D.4.2 Using ‘occur’
-------------------

Sometimes the ‘texinfo-show-structure’ command produces too much
information.  Perhaps you want to remind yourself of the overall
structure of a Texinfo file, and are overwhelmed by the detailed list
produced by ‘texinfo-show-structure’.  In this case, you can use the
‘occur’ command directly.  To do this, type:

     M-x occur

and then, when prompted, type a “regexp”, a regular expression for the
pattern you want to match.  (*Note Regular Expressions: (emacs)Regexps.)
The ‘occur’ command works from the current location of the cursor in the
buffer to the end of the buffer.  If you want to run ‘occur’ on the
whole buffer, place the cursor at the beginning of the buffer.

   For example, to see all the lines that contain the word ‘@chapter’ in
them, just type ‘@chapter’.  This will produce a list of the chapters.
It will also list all the sentences with ‘@chapter’ in the middle of the
line.

   If you want to see only those lines that start with the word
‘@chapter’, type ‘^@chapter’ when prompted by ‘occur’.  If you want to
see all the lines that end with a word or phrase, end the last word with
a ‘$’; for example, ‘catching mistakes$’.  This can be helpful when you
want to see all the nodes that are part of the same chapter or section
and therefore have the same 'Up' pointer.

   *Note Using Occur: (emacs)Other Repeating Search, for more
information.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: Updating Nodes and Menus,  Next: Info Formatting,  Prev: Showing the Structure,  Up: Texinfo Mode

D.5 Updating Nodes and Menus
============================

The ‘texi2any’ command will create an Info file for a hierarchically
organized Texinfo file that lacks 'Next', 'Previous' and 'Up' pointers
(*note Writing a Node::).  Thus, in general, there is no need for
explicit 'Next', 'Previous', and 'Up' pointers.  In this setting, menus
will be added automatically for nodes without an explicit menu.  (*Note
Generic Translator texi2any::, for more information about ‘texi2any’.)

   If you still want explicit pointers, Texinfo mode provides commands
for automatically creating or updating menus and node pointers.  The
commands are called "update" commands because their most frequent use is
for updating a Texinfo file after you have worked on it; but you can use
them to insert the 'Next', 'Previous', and 'Up' pointers into an ‘@node’
line that has none and to create menus in a file that has none.

File: texinfo.info,  Node: Updating Commands,  Next: Updating Requirements,  Up: Updating Nodes and Menus

D.5.1 The Updating Commands
---------------------------

You can use the updating commands to:

   • insert or update the 'Next', 'Previous', and 'Up' pointers of a
     node,

   • insert or update the menu for a section, and

   • create a master menu for a Texinfo source file.

   You can also use the commands to update all the nodes and menus in a
region or in a whole Texinfo file.

   The updating commands work only with conventional Texinfo files,
which are structured hierarchically like books.  In such files, a
structuring command line must follow closely after each ‘@node’ line,
except for the 'Top' ‘@node’ line.  (A “structuring command line” is a
line beginning with ‘@chapter’, ‘@section’, or other similar command.)

   You can write the structuring command line on the line that follows
immediately after an ‘@node’ line or else on the line that follows after
a single ‘@comment’ line or a single ‘@ifinfo’ line.  You cannot
interpose more than one line between the ‘@node’ line and the
structuring command line; and you may interpose only a ‘@comment’ line
or an ‘@ifinfo’ line.

   Commands which work on a whole buffer require that the 'Top' node be
followed by a node with a ‘@chapter’ or equivalent-level command.  The
menu updating commands will not create a main or master menu for a
Texinfo file that has only ‘@chapter’-level nodes!  The menu updating
commands only create menus _within_ nodes for lower level nodes.  To
create a menu of chapters, you must provide a 'Top' node.

   The menu updating commands remove menu entries that refer to other
Info files since they do not refer to nodes within the current buffer.
This is a deficiency.  Rather than use menu entries, you can use cross
references to refer to other Info files.  None of the updating commands
affect cross-references.

   Texinfo mode has five updating commands that are used most often: two
are for updating the node pointers or menu of a single node (or a
region); two are for updating every node pointer and menu in a file; and
one, the ‘texinfo-master-menu’ command, is for creating a master menu
for a complete file, and optionally, for updating every node and menu in
the whole Texinfo file.

   The ‘texinfo-master-menu’ command is the primary command:

‘C-c C-u m’
‘M-x texinfo-master-menu’
     Create or update a master menu that includes all the other menus
     (incorporating the descriptions from pre-existing menus, if any).

     With an argument (prefix argument, ‘C-u,’ if interactive), first
     create or update all the nodes and all the regular menus in the
     buffer before constructing the master menu.  (*Note The Top Node
     and Master Menu: The Top Node, for more about a master menu.)

     For ‘texinfo-master-menu’ to work, the Texinfo file must have a
     'Top' node and at least one subsequent node.

     After extensively editing a Texinfo file, you can type the
     following:

          C-u M-x texinfo-master-menu
     or
          C-u C-c C-u m

     This updates all the nodes and menus completely and all at once.

   The other major updating commands do smaller jobs and are designed
for the person who updates nodes and menus as he or she writes a Texinfo
file.

   The commands are:

‘C-c C-u C-n’
‘M-x texinfo-update-node’
     Insert the 'Next', 'Previous', and 'Up' pointers for the node that
     point is within (i.e., for the ‘@node’ line preceding point).  If
     the ‘@node’ line has pre-existing 'Next', 'Previous', or 'Up'
     pointers in it, the old pointers are removed and new ones inserted.
     With an argument (prefix argument, ‘C-u’, if interactive), this
     command updates all ‘@node’ lines in the region (which is the text
     between point and mark).

‘C-c C-u C-m’
‘M-x texinfo-make-menu’
     Create or update the menu in the node that point is within.  With
     an argument (‘C-u’ as prefix argument, if interactive), the command
     makes or updates menus for the nodes which are either within or a
     part of the region.

     Whenever ‘texinfo-make-menu’ updates an existing menu, the
     descriptions from that menu are incorporated into the new menu.
     This is done by copying descriptions from the existing menu to the
     entries in the new menu that have the same node names.  If the node
     names are different, the descriptions are not copied to the new
     menu.

‘C-c C-u C-e’
‘M-x texinfo-every-node-update’
     Insert or update the 'Next', 'Previous', and 'Up' pointers for
     every node in the buffer.

‘C-c C-u C-a’
‘M-x texinfo-all-menus-update’
     Create or update all the menus in the buffer.  With an argument
     (‘C-u’ as prefix argument, if interactive), first insert or update
     all the node pointers before working on the menus.

     If a master menu exists, the ‘texinfo-all-menus-update’ command
     updates it; but the command does not create a new master menu if
     none already exists.  (Use the ‘texinfo-master-menu’ command for
     that.)

     When working on a document that does not merit a master menu, you
     can type the following:

          C-u C-c C-u C-a
     or
          C-u M-x texinfo-all-menus-update

     This updates all the nodes and menus.

   The ‘texinfo-column-for-description’ variable specifies the column to
which menu descriptions are indented.  By default, the value is 32
although it can be useful to reduce it to as low as 24.  You can set the
variable via customization (*note (emacs)Customization::) or with the
‘M-x set-variable’ command (*note Examining and Setting Variables:
(emacs)Examining.).

   Also, the ‘texinfo-indent-menu-description’ command may be used to
indent existing menu descriptions to a specified column.  Finally, if
you wish, you can use the ‘texinfo-insert-node-lines’ command to insert
missing ‘@node’ lines into a file.  In particular, you can ignore
‘@node’ lines altogether in your first draft and then use the
‘texinfo-insert-node-lines’ command to create ‘@node’ lines for you.
However, we do not recommend this practice.  It is better to name the
node itself at the same time that you write a segment so you can easily
make cross-references.  Useful cross-references are an especially
important feature of a good Texinfo manual.  (*Note Other Updating
Commands::, for more information.)


File: texinfo.info,  Node: Updating Requirements,  Next: Update Multiple Files,  Prev: Updating Commands,  Up: Updating Nodes and Menus

D.5.2 Updating Requirements
---------------------------

To use the updating commands, you must organize the Texinfo file
hierarchically with chapters, sections, subsections, and the like.  When
you construct the hierarchy of the manual, do not 'jump down' more than
one level at a time: you can follow the 'Top' node with a chapter, but
not with a section; you can follow a chapter with a section, but not
with a subsection.  However, you may 'jump up' any number of levels at
one time--for example, from a subsection to a chapter.

   Each ‘@node’ line, with the exception of the line for the 'Top' node,
must be followed by a line with a structuring command such as
‘@chapter’, ‘@section’, or ‘@unnumberedsubsec’.

   Each ‘@node’ line/structuring-command line combination must look
either like this:

     @node     Comments,  Minimum, Conventions, Overview
     @comment  node-name, next,    previous,    up
     @section Comments

   or like this (without the ‘@comment’ line):

     @node Comments, Minimum, Conventions, Overview
     @section Comments

   or like this (without the explicit node pointers):

     @node Comments
     @section Comments

In this example, 'Comments' is the name of both the node and the
section.  The next node is called 'Minimum' and the previous node is
called 'Conventions'.  The 'Comments' section is within the 'Overview'
node, which is specified by the 'Up' pointer.

   If a file has a 'Top' node, it must be called ‘top’ or ‘Top’ and be
the first node in the file.

   The menu updating commands create a menu of sections within a
chapter, a menu of subsections within a section, and so on.  This means
that you must have a 'Top' node if you want a menu of chapters.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: Update Multiple Files,  Next: Include Files Requirements,  Prev: Updating Requirements,  Up: Updating Nodes and Menus

D.5.3 Update Outer File and Include Files
-----------------------------------------

GNU Emacs Texinfo mode provides the ‘texinfo-multiple-files-update’
command.  This command creates or updates 'Next', 'Previous', and 'Up'
pointers of included files as well as those in the outer or overall
Texinfo file, and it creates or updates a main menu in the outer file.
Depending on whether you call it with optional arguments, the command
updates only the pointers in the first ‘@node’ line of the included
files or all of them.

   With ‘C-u’ as a prefix argument, create and insert a master menu in
the outer file.  With a numeric prefix argument, such as ‘C-u 2’, first
update all the menus and all the 'Next', 'Previous', and 'Up' pointers
of all the included files before creating and inserting a master menu in
the outer file.

   In more details:

‘M-x texinfo-multiple-files-update’
     Called without any arguments:

        − Create or update the 'Next', 'Previous', and 'Up' pointers of
          the first ‘@node’ line in each file included in an outer or
          overall Texinfo file.

        − Create or update the 'Top' level node pointers of the outer or
          overall file.

        − Create or update a main menu in the outer file.

‘C-u M-x texinfo-multiple-files-update’
     Called with ‘C-u’ as a prefix argument:

        − Create or update pointers in the first ‘@node’ line in each
          included file.

        − Create or update the 'Top' level node pointers of the outer
          file.

        − Create and insert a master menu in the outer file.  The master
          menu is made from all the menus in all the included files.

‘C-u 8 M-x texinfo-multiple-files-update’
     Called with a numeric prefix argument, such as ‘C-u 8’:

        − Create or update _all_ the 'Next', 'Previous', and 'Up'
          pointers of all the included files.

        − Create or update _all_ the menus of all the included files.

        − Create or update the 'Top' level node pointers of the outer or
          overall file.

        − And then create a master menu in the outer file.  This is
          similar to invoking ‘texinfo-master-menu’ with an argument
          when you are working with just one file.

   Note the use of the prefix argument in interactive use: with a
regular prefix argument, just ‘C-u’, the ‘texinfo-multiple-files-update’
command inserts a master menu; with a numeric prefix argument, such as
‘C-u 8’, the command updates _every_ pointer and menu in _all_ the files
and then inserts a master menu.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: Include Files Requirements,  Next: Other Updating Commands,  Prev: Update Multiple Files,  Up: Updating Nodes and Menus

D.5.4 Include Files Requirements
--------------------------------

If you plan to use the ‘texinfo-multiple-files-update’ command, the
outer Texinfo file that lists included files within it should contain
nothing but the beginning and end parts of a Texinfo file, and a number
of ‘@include’ commands listing the included files.  It should not even
include indices, which should be listed in an included file of their
own.

   Moreover, each of the included files must contain exactly one highest
level node (conventionally, ‘@chapter’ or equivalent), and this node
must be the first node in the included file.  Furthermore, each of these
highest level nodes in each included file must be at the same
hierarchical level in the file structure.  Usually, each is a
‘@chapter’, an ‘@appendix’, or an ‘@unnumbered’ node.  Thus, normally,
each included file contains one, and only one, chapter or
equivalent-level node.

   The outer file should contain only _one_ node, the 'Top' node.  It
should _not_ contain any nodes besides the single 'Top' node.  The
‘texinfo-multiple-files-update’ command will not process them.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: Other Updating Commands,  Prev: Include Files Requirements,  Up: Updating Nodes and Menus

D.5.5 Other Updating Commands
-----------------------------

In addition to the major updating commands, Texinfo mode possesses
several less frequently used updating commands:

‘M-x texinfo-insert-node-lines’
     Insert ‘@node’ lines before the ‘@chapter’, ‘@section’, and other
     sectioning commands wherever they are missing throughout a region
     in a Texinfo file.

     With an argument (‘C-u’ as prefix argument, if interactive), the
     command ‘texinfo-insert-node-lines’ not only inserts ‘@node’ lines
     but also inserts the chapter or section titles as the names of the
     corresponding nodes.  In addition, it inserts the titles as node
     names in pre-existing ‘@node’ lines that lack names.  Since node
     names should be more concise than section or chapter titles, you
     must manually edit node names so inserted.

     For example, the following marks a whole buffer as a region and
     inserts ‘@node’ lines and titles throughout:

          C-x h C-u M-x texinfo-insert-node-lines

     This command inserts titles as node names in ‘@node’ lines; the
     ‘texinfo-start-menu-description’ command (*note Inserting
     Frequently Used Commands: Inserting.) inserts titles as
     descriptions in menu entries, a different action.  However, in both
     cases, you need to edit the inserted text.

‘M-x texinfo-indent-menu-description’
     Indent every description in the menu following point to the
     specified column.  You can use this command to give yourself more
     space for descriptions.  With an argument (‘C-u’ as prefix
     argument, if interactive), the ‘texinfo-indent-menu-description’
     command indents every description in every menu in the region.
     However, this command does not indent the second and subsequent
     lines of a multi-line description.

‘M-x texinfo-sequential-node-update’
     Insert the names of the nodes immediately following and preceding
     the current node as the 'Next' or 'Previous' pointers regardless of
     those nodes' hierarchical level.  This means that the 'Next' node
     of a subsection may well be the next chapter.  Sequentially ordered
     nodes are useful for novels and other documents that you read
     through sequentially.  (However, in Info, the ‘g *’ command lets
     you look through the file sequentially, so sequentially ordered
     nodes are not strictly necessary.)  With an argument (prefix
     argument, if interactive), the ‘texinfo-sequential-node-update’
     command sequentially updates all the nodes in the region.

D.6.1 Running ‘texi2any’/‘makeinfo’ Within Emacs
------------------------------------------------

The ‘texi2any’ program provides better error messages than either of the
Emacs formatting commands.  We recommend it.  The ‘texi2any’ program is
independent of Emacs.

   You can run ‘texi2any’ (or ‘makeinfo’) in GNU Emacs Texinfo mode by
using either the ‘makeinfo-region’ or the ‘makeinfo-buffer’ commands.
In Texinfo mode, the commands are bound to ‘C-c C-m C-r’ and ‘C-c C-m
C-b’ by default.

‘C-c C-m C-r’
‘M-x makeinfo-region’
     Format the current region for Info.

‘C-c C-m C-b’
‘M-x makeinfo-buffer’
     Format the current buffer for Info.

   When you invoke ‘makeinfo-region’ the output goes to a temporary
buffer.  When you invoke ‘makeinfo-buffer’ output goes to the file set
with ‘@setfilename’ (*note @setfilename::).

   The Emacs ‘makeinfo-region’ and ‘makeinfo-buffer’ commands run the
‘texi2any’ program in a temporary shell buffer.  If ‘texi2any’ finds any
errors, Emacs displays the error messages in the temporary buffer.

   You can parse the error messages by typing ‘C-x `’ (‘next-error’).
This causes Emacs to go to and position the cursor on the line in the
Texinfo source that ‘texi2any’ thinks caused the error.  *Note Running
‘make’ or Compilers Generally: (emacs)Compilation, for more information
about using the ‘next-error’ command.

   In addition, you can kill the shell in which the ‘texi2any’ command
is running or make the shell buffer display its most recent output.

‘C-c C-m C-k’
‘M-x makeinfo-kill-job’
     Kill the current running ‘texi2any’ (or ‘makeinfo’) job (from
     ‘makeinfo-region’ or ‘makeinfo-buffer’).

‘C-c C-m C-l’
‘M-x makeinfo-recenter-output-buffer’
     Redisplay the ‘texi2any’ shell buffer to display its most recent
     output.

(Note that the parallel commands for killing and recentering a TeX job
are ‘C-c C-t C-k’ and ‘C-c C-t C-l’.  *Note Texinfo Mode Printing::.)

   You can specify options for ‘texi2any’ by setting the
‘makeinfo-options’ variable with either the ‘M-x customize’ or the ‘M-x
set-variable’ command, or by setting the variable in your ‘.emacs’
initialization file.

   For example, you could write the following in your ‘.emacs’ file:

     (setq makeinfo-options
          "--paragraph-indent=0 --no-split
           --fill-column=70 --verbose")

D.6.2 The ‘texinfo-format...’ Commands
--------------------------------------

In GNU Emacs in Texinfo mode, you can format part or all of a Texinfo
file with the ‘texinfo-format-region’ command.  This formats the current
region and displays the formatted text in a temporary buffer called
‘*Info Region*’.

   Similarly, you can format a buffer with the ‘texinfo-format-buffer’
command.  This command creates a new buffer and generates the Info file
in it.  Typing ‘C-x C-s’ will save the Info file under the name
specified by the ‘@setfilename’ line which must be near the beginning of
the Texinfo file.

‘C-c C-e C-r’
‘texinfo-format-region’
     Format the current region for Info.

‘C-c C-e C-b’
‘texinfo-format-buffer’
     Format the current buffer for Info.

   The ‘texinfo-format-region’ and ‘texinfo-format-buffer’ commands
provide you with some error checking, and other functions can provide
you with further help in finding formatting errors.  These procedures
are described in an appendix; see *note Catching Mistakes::.  However,
the ‘texi2any’ program provides better error checking (*note texi2any in
Emacs::).

   A peculiarity of the ‘texinfo-format-buffer’ and
‘texinfo-format-region’ commands is that they do not indent (nor fill)
paragraphs that contain ‘@w’ or ‘@*’ commands.

D.7 Formatting and Printing with Emacs
======================================

GNU Emacs can be used for formatting and printing with TeX, from an
Emacs Shell.  Texinfo mode also provides predefined key commands for
formatting and printing.

* Menu:

* Texinfo Mode Printing::      How to format and print part or all of a file.
* Compile-Command::            How to print using Emacs's compile command.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: Texinfo Mode Printing,  Next: Compile-Command,  Up: Printing with Emacs

D.7.1 Formatting and Printing in Texinfo Mode
---------------------------------------------

Texinfo mode provides several predefined key commands for TeX formatting
and printing.  These include commands for sorting indices, looking at
the printer queue, killing the formatting job, and recentering the
display of the buffer in which the operations occur.

   Often, when you are writing a document, you want to typeset and print
only part of a file to see what it will look like.  You can use the
‘texinfo-tex-region’ and related commands for this purpose.  Use the
‘texinfo-tex-buffer’ command to format all of a buffer.

   For ‘texinfo-tex-region’ or ‘texinfo-tex-buffer’ to work, the file
_must_ start with a ‘\input texinfo’ line and must include a ‘@settitle’
line.  The file must end with ‘@bye’ on a line by itself.  (When you use
‘texinfo-tex-region’, you must surround the ‘@settitle’ line with
start-of-header and end-of-header lines.)

‘C-c C-t C-b’
‘M-x texinfo-tex-buffer’
     Run ‘texi2dvi’ on the buffer.  In addition to running TeX on the
     buffer, this command automatically creates or updates indices as
     needed.

‘C-c C-t C-r’
‘M-x texinfo-tex-region’
     Run TeX on the current region.

     If @-commands related to printed output are between the
     start-of-header and end-of-header lines, then ‘texinfo-tex-region’
     will format the region accordingly.  For example, if you write the
     ‘@smallbook’ command between the start-of-header and end-of-header
     lines, ‘texinfo-tex-region’, will format the region in "small" book
     size.

‘C-c C-t C-i’
‘M-x texinfo-texindex’
     Run ‘texindex’ to sort the indices of a Texinfo file formatted with
     ‘texinfo-tex-region’.  The ‘texinfo-tex-region’ command does not
     run ‘texindex’ automatically; it only runs the ‘tex’ typesetting
     command.  You must run the ‘texinfo-tex-region’ command a second
     time after sorting the raw index files with the ‘texindex’ command.
     (Usually, you do not format an index when you format a region, only
     when you format a buffer.  Now that the ‘texi2dvi’ command exists,
     there is little or no need for this command.)

‘C-c C-t C-p’
‘M-x texinfo-tex-print’
     Print a DVI file that was made with ‘texinfo-tex-region’ or
     ‘texinfo-tex-buffer’.

‘C-c C-t C-q’
‘M-x tex-show-print-queue’
     Show the print queue.

‘C-c C-t C-d’
‘M-x texinfo-delete-from-print-queue’
     Delete a job from the print queue; you will be prompted for the job
     number shown by a preceding ‘C-c C-t C-q’ command
     (‘texinfo-show-tex-print-queue’).

‘C-c C-t C-k’
‘M-x tex-kill-job’
     Kill the currently running TeX job started by either
     ‘texinfo-tex-region’ or ‘texinfo-tex-buffer’, or any other process
     running in the Texinfo shell buffer.

‘C-c C-t C-x’
‘M-x texinfo-quit-job’
     Quit a TeX formatting job that has stopped because of an error by
     sending an <x> to it.  When you do this, TeX preserves a record of
     what it did in a ‘.log’ file.

‘C-c C-t C-l’
‘M-x tex-recenter-output-buffer’
     Redisplay the shell buffer in which the TeX printing and formatting
     commands are run to show its most recent output.

   Thus, the usual sequence of commands for formatting a buffer is as
follows (with comments to the right):

     C-c C-t C-b             Run ‘texi2dvi’ on the buffer.
     C-c C-t C-p             Print the DVI file.
     C-c C-t C-q             Display the printer queue.

   The Texinfo mode TeX formatting commands start a subshell in Emacs
called the ‘*tex-shell*’.  The ‘texinfo-tex-command’,
‘texinfo-texindex-command’, and ‘tex-dvi-print-command’ commands are all
run in this shell.

   You can watch the commands operate in the ‘*tex-shell*’ buffer, and
you can switch to and from and use the ‘*tex-shell*’ buffer as you would
any other shell buffer.

   The formatting and print commands depend on the values of several
variables.  The default values are:

         Variable                              Default value

     texinfo-texi2dvi-command                  "texi2dvi"
     texinfo-tex-command                       "tex"
     texinfo-texindex-command                  "texindex"
     texinfo-delete-from-print-queue-command   "lprm"
     texinfo-tex-trailer                       "@bye"
     tex-start-of-header                       "%**start"
     tex-end-of-header                         "%**end"
     tex-dvi-print-command                     "lpr -d"
     tex-show-queue-command                    "lpq"

   You can change the values of these variables with the ‘M-x
set-variable’ command (*note Examining and Setting Variables:
(emacs)Examining.), or with your ‘.emacs’ initialization file (*note
(emacs)Init File::).

   Beginning with version 20, GNU Emacs offers a user-friendly
interface, called “Customize”, for changing values of user-definable
variables.  *Note Easy Customization Interface: (emacs)Easy
Customization, for more details about this.  The Texinfo variables can
be found in the ‘Development/Docs/Texinfo’ group, once you invoke the
‘M-x customize’ command.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: Compile-Command,  Prev: Texinfo Mode Printing,  Up: Printing with Emacs

D.7.2 Using the Local Variables List
------------------------------------

Yet another way to apply the TeX formatting command to a Texinfo file is
to put that command in a “local variables list” at the end of the
Texinfo file.  You can then specify the ‘tex’ or ‘texi2dvi’ commands as
a ‘compile-command’ and have Emacs run it by typing ‘M-x compile’.  This
creates a special shell called the ‘*compilation*’ buffer in which Emacs
runs the compile command.  For example, at the end of the ‘gdb.texi’
file, after the ‘@bye’, you could put the following:

     Local Variables:
     compile-command: "texi2dvi gdb.texi"
     End:

This technique is most often used by programmers who also compile
programs this way; see *note (emacs)Compilation::.

D.8 Texinfo Mode Summary
========================

In Texinfo mode, each set of commands has default keybindings that begin
with the same keys.  All the commands that are custom-created for
Texinfo mode begin with ‘C-c’.  The keys are somewhat mnemonic.

Insert Commands
---------------

The insert commands are invoked by typing ‘C-c’ twice and then the first
letter of the @-command to be inserted.  (It might make more sense
mnemonically to use ‘C-c C-i’, for 'custom insert', but ‘C-c C-c’ is
quick to type.)

     C-c C-c c       Insert ‘@code’.
     C-c C-c d       Insert ‘@dfn’.
     C-c C-c e       Insert ‘@end’.
     C-c C-c i       Insert ‘@item’.
     C-c C-c n       Insert ‘@node’.
     C-c C-c s       Insert ‘@samp’.
     C-c C-c v       Insert ‘@var’.
     C-c {       Insert braces.
     C-c ]
     C-c }       Move out of enclosing braces.

     C-c C-c C-d     Insert a node's section title
                    in the space for the description
                    in a menu entry line.

Show Structure
--------------

The ‘texinfo-show-structure’ command is often used within a narrowed
region.

     C-c C-s         List all the headings.

The Master Update Command
-------------------------

The ‘texinfo-master-menu’ command creates a master menu; and can be used
to update every node and menu in a file as well.

     C-c C-u m
     M-x texinfo-master-menu
                    Create or update a master menu.

     C-u C-c C-u m   With ‘C-u’ as a prefix argument, first
                    create or update all nodes and regular
                    menus, and then create a master menu.

Update Pointers
---------------

The update pointer commands are invoked by typing ‘C-c C-u’ and then
either ‘C-n’ for ‘texinfo-update-node’ or ‘C-e’ for
‘texinfo-every-node-update’.

     C-c C-u C-n     Update a node.
     C-c C-u C-e     Update every node in the buffer.

Update Menus
------------

Invoke the update menu commands by typing ‘C-c C-u’ and then either
‘C-m’ for ‘texinfo-make-menu’ or ‘C-a’ for ‘texinfo-all-menus-update’.
To update both nodes and menus at the same time, precede ‘C-c C-u C-a’
with ‘C-u’.

     C-c C-u C-m     Make or update a menu.

     C-c C-u C-a     Make or update all
                    menus in a buffer.

     C-u C-c C-u C-a With ‘C-u’ as a prefix argument,
                    first create or update all nodes and
                    then create or update all menus.

Format for Info
---------------

The Info formatting commands that are written in Emacs Lisp are invoked
by typing ‘C-c C-e’ and then either ‘C-r’ for a region or ‘C-b’ for the
whole buffer.

   The Info formatting commands that are based on the
‘texi2any’/‘makeinfo’ program are invoked by typing ‘C-c C-m’ and then
either ‘C-r’ for a region or ‘C-b’ for the whole buffer.

Use the ‘texinfo-format...’ commands:

     C-c C-e C-r     Format the region.
     C-c C-e C-b     Format the buffer.

Use ‘texi2any’/‘makeinfo’:

     C-c C-m C-r     Format the region.
     C-c C-m C-b     Format the buffer.
     C-c C-m C-l     Recenter the ‘texi2any’ output buffer.
     C-c C-m C-k     Kill the ‘texi2any’ formatting job.

Typeset and Print
-----------------

The TeX typesetting and printing commands are invoked by typing ‘C-c
C-t’ and then another control command: ‘C-r’ for ‘texinfo-tex-region’,
‘C-b’ for ‘texinfo-tex-buffer’, and so on.

     C-c C-t C-r     Run TeX on the region.
     C-c C-t C-b     Run texi2dvi on the buffer.
     C-c C-t C-i     Run texindex.
     C-c C-t C-p     Print the DVI file.
     C-c C-t C-q     Show the print queue.
     C-c C-t C-d     Delete a job from the print queue.
     C-c C-t C-k     Kill the current TeX formatting job.
     C-c C-t C-x     Quit a currently stopped TeX formatting job.
     C-c C-t C-l     Recenter the output buffer.

Other Updating Commands
-----------------------

The remaining updating commands do not have standard keybindings because
they are rarely used.

     M-x texinfo-insert-node-lines
                    Insert missing ‘@node’ lines in region.
                    With ‘C-u’ as a prefix argument,
                    use section titles as node names.

     M-x texinfo-multiple-files-update
                    Update a multi-file document.
                    With ‘C-u 2’ as a prefix argument,
                    create or update all nodes and menus
                    in all included files first.

     M-x texinfo-indent-menu-description
                    Indent descriptions.

     M-x texinfo-sequential-node-update
                    Insert node pointers in strict sequence.

D.9 Direct Formatting of Info files
===================================

In general, there is no need to edit or process Info files.  Most of the
content of Info file is plain text, but the tag tables require computing
offsets for nodes and indirect files (*note Tag and Split Files::),
which is impractical.  The Texinfo processors output well-formatted Info
from Texinfo input.  Also, lot of information from the Texinfo source is
lost in the Info file.  The Texinfo source is therefore more suitable to
analyse a manual, be it for error reporting, for statistics, or to set
up translations.

   Still, especially with manually written Info files, there are some
situations where it may be interesting to process Info files directly,
in particular to compute Info files node offsets and to compute split
Info files file offsets.  Two Emacs commands do that.  ‘Info-tagify’
adds a tag table for a nonsplit file lacking one.  This function is also
useful for Info file validation (*note Running Info-validate::).  It is
also possible to split a nonsplit Info file with ‘Info-split’.

* Menu:

* Tagifying::                  How to tagify a file.
* Splitting::                  How to split a file manually.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: Tagifying,  Next: Splitting,  Up: Formatting Info files

D.9.1 Tagifying a File
----------------------

Texinfo processors create tag tables automatically.  The only exception
arise when ‘texinfo-format-buffer’ is called with a prefix, as ‘C-u M-x
texinfo-format-buffer’, to create an non split Info file without a tag
table (which can be useful in some cases for Info file validation, *note
Unsplit and Tagify::).  Adding a tag table is therefore more generally
useful for manually written Info files.

   To create a tag table for an nonsplit file, visit the Info file you
wish to tagify and type:

     M-x Info-tagify

(Note the uppercase ‘I’ in ‘Info-tagify’.)  This creates an Info file
with a tag table.  A tag table is part of a well formed Info file (*note
Tag and Split Files::).  A tag table is also needed to validate or split
the Info file.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: Splitting,  Prev: Tagifying,  Up: Formatting Info files

D.9.2 Splitting a File Manually
-------------------------------

You should split a large file or else let the ‘texinfo-format-buffer’ or
‘makeinfo-buffer’ command do it for you automatically.  (Generally you
will let one of the formatting commands do this job for you.  *Note Info
Formatting::.)

   The split-off files are called the indirect subfiles.

   Tag tables are created automatically by the formatting command; you
only need to create a tag table yourself if you are doing the job
manually.  *Note Tagifying::, for information about creating a tag
table.

   Visit the Info file you wish to tagify and split manually and type
the two commands:

     M-x Info-tagify
     M-x Info-split

(Note that the ‘I’ in ‘Info’ is uppercase.)

   When you use the ‘Info-split’ command, the buffer is modified into a
(small) Info file which lists the indirect subfiles.  This file should
be saved in place of the original visited file.  The indirect subfiles
are written in the same directory the original file is in, with names
generated by appending ‘-’ and a number to the original file name.

   The primary file still functions as an Info file, but it contains
just the tag table and a directory of subfiles.  *Note Tag and Split
Files::.

D.10 Catching Mistakes
======================

Besides mistakes in the content of your documentation, there are two
kinds of mistake you can make with Texinfo: you can make mistakes with
@-commands, and you can make mistakes with the structure of the nodes
and chapters.

   For finding problems with @-commands, you can run TeX or a region
formatting command on the region that has a problem; indeed, you can run
these commands on each region as you write it.

   For finding problems with the structure of nodes and chapters, you
can use ‘C-c C-s’ (‘texinfo-show-structure’) and the related ‘occur’
command and you can use the ‘M-x Info-validate’ command.

* Menu:

* Debugging with Info::        How to catch errors with Info formatting.
* Debugging with TeX::         How to catch errors with TeX formatting.
* Running Info-validate::      How to find badly referenced nodes.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: texi2any Preferred,  Next: Debugging with Info,  Up: Catching Mistakes

D.10.1 ‘texi2any’ Preferred
---------------------------

The ‘texi2any’ program does an excellent job of catching errors and
reporting them--far better than ‘texinfo-format-region’ or
‘texinfo-format-buffer’.  In addition, the various functions for
automatically creating and updating node pointers and menus remove many
opportunities for human error.

   Use ‘texi2any’ (or its Texinfo mode manifestations, ‘makeinfo-region’
and ‘makeinfo-buffer’) to format your file and check for other errors.
This is the best way to work with Texinfo.  But if you cannot use
‘texi2any’, or your problem is very puzzling, then you may want to use
the tools described in this section.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: Debugging with Info,  Next: Debugging with TeX,  Prev: texi2any Preferred,  Up: Catching Mistakes

D.10.2 Catching Errors with Info Formatting
-------------------------------------------

After you have written part of a Texinfo file, you can use the
‘texinfo-format-region’ or the ‘makeinfo-region’ command to see whether
the region formats properly.

   Most likely, however, you are reading this section because for some
reason you cannot use the ‘makeinfo-region’ command; therefore, the rest
of this section presumes that you are using ‘texinfo-format-region’.

   If you have made a mistake with an @-command, ‘texinfo-format-region’
will stop processing at or after the error and display an error message.
To see where in the buffer the error occurred, switch to the ‘*Info
Region*’ buffer; the cursor will be in a position that is after the
location of the error.  Also, the text will not be formatted after the
place where the error occurred (or more precisely, where it was
detected).

   For example, if you accidentally end a menu with the command ‘@end
menus’ with an 's' on the end, instead of with ‘@end menu’, you will see
an error message that says:

     @end menus is not handled by texinfo

The cursor will stop at the point in the buffer where the error occurs,
or not long after it.  The buffer will look like this:

     ---------- Buffer: *Info Region* ----------
     * Menu:

     * Using texinfo-show-structure::  How to use
                                      `texinfo-show-structure'
                                      to catch mistakes.
     * Running Info-validate::         How to check for
                                      unreferenced nodes.
     @end menus
     ⋆
     ---------- Buffer: *Info Region* ----------

   The ‘texinfo-format-region’ command sometimes provides slightly odd
error messages.  For example, the following cross-reference fails to
format:

     (@xref{Catching Mistakes, for more info.)

In this case, ‘texinfo-format-region’ detects the missing closing brace
but displays a message that says ‘Unbalanced parentheses’ rather than
‘Unbalanced braces’.  This is because the formatting command looks for
mismatches between braces as if they were parentheses.

   Sometimes ‘texinfo-format-region’ fails to detect mistakes.  For
example, in the following, the closing brace is swapped with the closing
parenthesis:

     (@xref{Catching Mistakes), for more info.}

Formatting produces:
     (*Note for more info.: Catching Mistakes)

   The only way for you to detect this error is to realize that the
reference should have looked like this:

     (*Note Catching Mistakes::, for more info.)

   Incidentally, if you are reading this node in Info and type ‘f <RET>’
(‘Info-follow-reference’), you will generate an error message that says:

     No such node: "Catching Mistakes) The only way ...

This is because Info perceives the example of the error as the first
cross-reference in this node and if you type a <RET> immediately after
typing the Info ‘f’ command, Info will attempt to go to the referenced
node.  If you type ‘f catch <TAB> <RET>’, Info will complete the node
name of the correctly written example and take you to the 'Catching
Mistakes' node.  (If you try this, you can return from the 'Catching
Mistakes' node by typing ‘l’ (‘Info-last’).)

You can also catch mistakes when you format a file with TeX.

   Usually, you will want to do this after you have run
‘texinfo-format-buffer’ (or, better, ‘makeinfo-buffer’) on the same
file, because ‘texinfo-format-buffer’ sometimes displays error messages
that make more sense than TeX.  (*Note Debugging with Info::, for more
information.)

   For example, TeX was run on a Texinfo file, part of which is shown
here:

     ---------- Buffer: texinfo.texi ----------
     name of the Texinfo file as an extension.  The
     @samp{??} are `wildcards' that cause the shell to
     substitute all the raw index files.  (@xref{sorting
     indices, for more information about sorting
     indices.)
     ---------- Buffer: texinfo.texi ----------

(The cross-reference lacks a closing brace.)  TeX produced the following
output, after which it stopped:

     ---------- Buffer: *tex-shell* ----------
     Runaway argument?
     {sorting indices, for more information about sorting
     indices.) @ETC.
     ! Paragraph ended before @xref was complete.
     <to be read again>
                       @par
     l.27

     ?
     ---------- Buffer: *tex-shell* ----------

   In this case, TeX produced an accurate and understandable error
message:

     Paragraph ended before @xref was complete.

‘@par’ is an internal TeX command of no relevance to Texinfo.  ‘l.27’
means that TeX detected the problem on line 27 of the Texinfo file.  The
‘?’ is the prompt TeX uses in this circumstance.

   Unfortunately, TeX is not always so helpful, and sometimes you must
truly be a Sherlock Holmes to discover what went wrong.

   In any case, if you run into a problem like this, you can do one of
three things.

  1. You can tell TeX to continue running and ignore just this error by
     typing <RET> at the ‘?’ prompt.

  2. You can tell TeX to continue running and to ignore all errors as
     best it can by typing ‘r <RET>’ at the ‘?’ prompt.

     This is often the best thing to do.  However, beware: the one error
     may produce a cascade of additional error messages as its
     consequences are felt through the rest of the file.  To stop TeX
     when it is producing such an avalanche of error messages, type
     ‘C-c’ (or ‘C-c C-c’, if you are running a shell inside Emacs).

  3. You can tell TeX to stop this run by typing ‘x <RET>’ at the ‘?’
     prompt.

   If you are running TeX inside Emacs, you need to switch to the shell
buffer and line at which TeX offers the ‘?’ prompt.

   Sometimes TeX will format a file without producing error messages
even though there is a problem.  This usually occurs if a command is not
ended but TeX is able to continue processing anyhow.  For example, if
you fail to end an itemized list with the ‘@end itemize’ command, TeX
will write a DVI file that you can print out.  The only error message
that TeX will give you is the somewhat mysterious comment:

     (@end occurred inside a group at level 1)

However, if you print the DVI file, you will find that the text of the
file that follows the itemized list is entirely indented as if it were
part of the last item in the itemized list.  The error message is the
way TeX says that it expected to find an ‘@end’ command somewhere in the
file; but that it could not determine where it was needed.

   Another source of notoriously hard-to-find errors is a missing ‘@end
group’ command.  If you ever are stumped by incomprehensible errors,
look for a missing ‘@end group’ command first.

   If the Texinfo file lacks header lines, TeX may stop in the beginning
of its run and display output that looks like the following.  The ‘*’
indicates that TeX is waiting for input.

     This is TeX, Version 3.14159 (Web2c 7.0)
     (test.texinfo [1])
     *

In this case, simply type ‘\end <RET>’ after the asterisk.  Then write
the header lines in the Texinfo file and run the TeX command again.
(Note the use of the backslash, ‘\’.  TeX uses ‘\’ instead of ‘@’; and
in this circumstance, you are working directly with TeX, not with
Texinfo.)

D.10.4 Finding Badly Referenced Nodes
-------------------------------------

You can use the ‘Info-validate’ command to check whether any of the
'Next', 'Previous', 'Up' or other node pointers fail to point to a node.
This command checks that every node pointer points to an existing node.
The ‘Info-validate’ command works only on Info files, not on Texinfo
files.

   The ‘texi2any’ program validates pointers automatically, so you do
not need to use the ‘Info-validate’ command if you are using ‘texi2any’.
With the customization variable ‘CHECK_NORMAL_MENU_STRUCTURE’ set,
‘texi2any’ will also warn if the nodes pointers (either explicitly or
automatically set) are not consistent with the order of node menu
entries.  ‘texi2any’ does not check that every 'Next' pointer is matched
by a 'Previous' (in the node where the 'Next' points) which points back,
since it may be correct for a non standard document structure.

   You only may need to use ‘Info-validate’ if you are unable to run
‘texi2any’ and instead must create an Info file using
‘texinfo-format-region’ or ‘texinfo-format-buffer’, or if you write an
Info file from scratch.

File: texinfo.info,  Node: Using Info-validate,  Next: Unsplit and Tagify,  Up: Running Info-validate

D.10.4.1 Using ‘Info-validate’
..............................

To use ‘Info-validate’, visit the Info file you wish to check and type:

     M-x Info-validate

Note that the ‘Info-validate’ command requires an uppercase 'I'.  You
may also need to create a tag table before running ‘Info-validate’.
*Note Tagifying::.

   If your file is valid, you will receive a message that says "File
appears valid".  However, if you have a pointer that does not point to a
node, error messages will be displayed in a buffer called ‘*problems in
info file*’.

   For example, ‘Info-validate’ was run on a test file that contained
only the first node of this manual.  One of the messages said:

     In node "Overview", invalid Next: Texinfo Mode

This meant that the node called ‘Overview’ had a 'Next' pointer that did
not point to anything (which was true in this case, since the test file
had only one node in it).

   Now suppose we add a node named ‘Texinfo Mode’ to our test case but
we do not specify a 'Previous' for this node.  Then we will get the
following error message:

     In node "Texinfo Mode", should have Previous: Overview

This is because, with a standard document structure, every 'Next'
pointer should be matched by a 'Previous' (in the node where the 'Next'
points) which points back.

   ‘Info-validate’ also checks that all menu entries and
cross-references point to actual nodes.

   ‘Info-validate’ requires a tag table and does not work with files
that have been split.  (The ‘texinfo-format-buffer’ command
automatically splits large files.)  In order to use ‘Info-validate’ on a
large file, you must run ‘texinfo-format-buffer’ with an argument so
that it does not split the Info file; and you must create a tag table
for the unsplit file.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: Unsplit and Tagify,  Prev: Using Info-validate,  Up: Running Info-validate

D.10.4.2 Creating an Unsplit File and Adding a Tag Table
........................................................

You can run ‘Info-validate’ only on a single Info file that has a tag
table.  The command will not work on the indirect subfiles that are
generated when a master file is split.  If you have a large file (longer
than 300,000 bytes or so), you need to run the ‘texinfo-format-buffer’
or ‘makeinfo-buffer’ command in such a way that it does not create
indirect subfiles.  You will also need to create a tag table for the
Info file.  After you have done this, you can run ‘Info-validate’ and
look for badly referenced nodes.

   The first step is to create an unsplit Info file.  To prevent
‘texinfo-format-buffer’ from splitting a Texinfo file into smaller Info
files, give a prefix to the ‘M-x texinfo-format-buffer’ command:

     C-u M-x texinfo-format-buffer

or else

     C-u C-c C-e C-b

When you do this, ‘texinfo-format-buffer’ will not split the file and
will not create a tag table for it.

   After creating an unsplit Info file, you must create a tag table for
it (*note Tagifying::).  Visit the unsplit Info file created by
‘texinfo-format-buffer’ and type:

     M-x Info-tagify

   The third step is to validate the Info file:

     M-x Info-validate

(Note the uppercase ‘I’ in ‘Info-validate’.)  In brief, the steps are:

     C-u M-x texinfo-format-buffer
     M-x Info-tagify
     M-x Info-validate

   After you have validated the node structure, you can rerun
‘texinfo-format-buffer’ in the normal way so it will construct a tag
table and split the file automatically, or you can make the tag table
and split the file manually (*note Splitting::).


File: texinfo.info,  Node: Batch Formatting,  Prev: Catching Mistakes,  Up: Texinfo Mode

D.11 Batch Formatting
=====================

You can format Texinfo files for Info using ‘batch-texinfo-format’ and
Emacs batch mode.  You can run Emacs in batch mode from any shell,
including a shell inside of Emacs.  (*Note (emacs)Initial Options::.)

   Here is a shell command to format all the files that end in
‘.texinfo’ in the current directory:

     emacs -batch -funcall batch-texinfo-format *.texinfo

Emacs processes all the files listed on the command line, even if an
error occurs while attempting to format some of them.

   Run ‘batch-texinfo-format’ only with Emacs in batch mode as shown; it
is not interactive.  It kills the batch mode Emacs on completion.

   ‘batch-texinfo-format’ is convenient if you lack ‘texi2any’ and want
to format several Texinfo files at once.  When you use Batch mode, you
create a new Emacs process.  This frees your current Emacs, so you can
continue working in it.  (When you run ‘texinfo-format-region’ or
‘texinfo-format-buffer’, you cannot use that Emacs for anything else
until the command finishes.)

File: texinfo.info,  Node: @setchapternewpage,  Next: Headings,  Up: Global Document Commands

E.1 ‘@setchapternewpage’: Blank Pages Before Chapters
=====================================================

In an officially bound book, text is usually printed on both sides of
the paper, chapters start on right-hand pages, and right-hand pages have
odd numbers.  But in short reports, text often is printed only on one
side of the paper.  Also in short reports, chapters sometimes do not
start on new pages, but are printed on the same page as the end of the
preceding chapter, after a small amount of vertical whitespace.

   You can use the ‘@setchapternewpage’ command with various arguments
to specify how chapters should be started in printed output and whether
headers should be formatted for printing on one or both sides of the
paper (single-sided or double-sided printing).

   Write the ‘@setchapternewpage’ command at the beginning of a line
followed by its argument.  For example, you would write the following to
cause each chapter to start on a fresh odd-numbered page:

     @setchapternewpage odd

   You can specify one of three alternatives with the
‘@setchapternewpage’ command:

‘@setchapternewpage off’
     Typeset a new chapter on the same page as the last chapter, after
     skipping some vertical whitespace.  Also, format page headers for
     single-sided printing.

‘@setchapternewpage on’
     Start new chapters on new pages and format page headers for
     single-sided printing.  This is the form most often used for short
     reports or personal printing.  This is the default.

‘@setchapternewpage odd’
     Start new chapters on new, odd-numbered pages (right-handed pages)
     and typeset for double-sided printing.  This is the form most often
     used for books and manuals.

   Texinfo does not have a ‘@setchapternewpage even’ command, because
there is no printing tradition of starting chapters or books on an
even-numbered page.

   If you don't like the default headers that ‘@setchapternewpage’ sets,
you can explicit control them with the ‘@headings’ command.  *Note
@headings::.

   At the beginning of a manual or book, pages are not numbered--for
example, the title and copyright pages of a book are not numbered.  By
convention, table of contents and frontmatter pages are numbered with
roman numerals and not in sequence with the rest of the document.

   The ‘@setchapternewpage’ has no effect in output formats that do not
have pages, such as Info and HTML.

   We recommend not including any ‘@setchapternewpage’ command in your
document source at all, since such desired pagination is not intrinsic
to the document.  For a particular hard copy run, if you don't want the
default output (no blank pages, same headers on all pages) use the
‘--texinfo’ option to ‘texi2dvi’ to specify the output you want.

E.2 Page Headings
=================

Most printed manuals contain headings along the top of every page except
the title and copyright pages.  Some manuals also contain footings.
Headings and footings have no meaning in Info or the other output
formats.

   Texinfo provides two standard heading formats, one for manuals
printed on one side of each sheet of paper, and the other for manuals
printed on both sides of the paper.  By default, nothing is specified
for the footing of a Texinfo file, so the footing remains blank.

   Texinfo also has several heading and footing commands that you can
use to generate your own heading and footing formats.

   In Texinfo, headings and footings are single lines at the tops and
bottoms of pages; you cannot create multiline headings or footings.
Each header or footer line is divided into three parts: a left part, a
middle part, and a right part.  Any part, or a whole line, may be left
blank.  Text for the left part of a header or footer line is set
flushleft; text for the middle part is centered; and, text for the right
part is set flushright.

* Menu:

* @headings::                  An option for turning headings on and off and
                               double or single sided printing.
* Heading Format::             Standard page heading formats.
* Custom Headings::            How to create your own headings and footings.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: @headings,  Next: Heading Format,  Up: Headings

E.2.1 The ‘@headings’ Command
-----------------------------

The ‘@headings’ command is rarely used.  It specifies what kinds of page
headings and footings to print on each page.  Usually, this is
controlled by the ‘@setchapternewpage’ command.  You need the
‘@headings’ command only if the ‘@setchapternewpage’ command does not do
what you want.

   You can use ‘@headings’ as follows:

‘@headings off’
     Turn off printing of page headings.

‘@headings single’
     Turn on page headings appropriate for single-sided printing.

‘@headings double’
     Turn on page headings appropriate for double-sided printing.

‘@headings singleafter’
‘@headings doubleafter’
     Turn on ‘single’ or ‘double’ headings, respectively, after the
     current page is output.

‘@headings on’
     Turn on page headings: ‘single’ if ‘@setchapternewpage on’,
     ‘double’ otherwise.

   For example, suppose you write ‘@setchapternewpage off’ before the
‘@titlepage’ command to start a new chapter on the same page as the end
of the last chapter.  This command also causes page headers to be
typeset for single-sided printing.  To cause page headers to be typeset
for double-sided printing, write ‘@headings double’.

   You can stop any page headings at all from being generated by writing
‘@headings off’ on a line of its own, like this:

     @headings off


File: texinfo.info,  Node: Heading Format,  Next: Custom Headings,  Prev: @headings,  Up: Headings

E.2.2 Standard Heading Formats
------------------------------

Texinfo provides two standard heading formats, one for manuals printed
on one side of each sheet of paper, and the other for manuals printed on
both sides of the paper.

   The standard format for single-sided printing consists of a header
line in which the left-hand part contains the name of the chapter, the
central part is blank, and the right-hand part contains the page number.
A single-sided page looks like this:

       _______________________
      |                       |
      | chapter   page number |
      |                       |
      | Start of text ...     |
      | ...                   |
      |                       |

   In the standard double-sided format, the left part of the left-hand
(even-numbered) page contains the page number, the central part is
blank, and the right part contains the title (specified by the
‘@settitle’ command).  The left part of the right-hand (odd-numbered)
page contains the name of the chapter, the central part is blank, and
the right part contains the page number.  An even-numbered page and an
odd-numbered page, side by side as in an open book, look like this:

       _______________________     _______________________
      |                       |   |                       |
      | page number     title |   | chapter   page number |
      |                       |   |                       |
      | Start of text ...     |   | More  text ...        |
      | ...                   |   | ...                   |
      |                       |   |                       |

The chapter name is preceded by the word "Chapter", the chapter number
and a colon.  This makes it easier to keep track of where you are in the
manual.

   Note that on pages where a new chapter starts, some text may be
omitted from the heading line.

   By default, nothing is specified for the footing of a Texinfo file,
so the footing remains blank.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: Custom Headings,  Prev: Heading Format,  Up: Headings

E.2.3 How to Make Your Own Headings
-----------------------------------

You can use the standard headings provided with Texinfo or specify your
own.  By default, Texinfo has no footers, so if you specify them, the
available page size for the main text will be slightly reduced.

   Texinfo provides six commands for specifying headings and footings:
   • ‘@everyheading’ and ‘@everyfooting’ generate page headers and
     footers that are the same for both even- and odd-numbered pages.
   • ‘@evenheading’ and ‘@evenfooting’ commands generate headers and
     footers for even-numbered (left-hand) pages.
   • ‘@oddheading’ and ‘@oddfooting’ generate headers and footers for
     odd-numbered (right-hand) pages.

   You must cancel the predefined heading commands with the ‘@headings
off’ command before defining your own specifications.

   Here is how to place the chapter name at the left, the page number in
the center, and the date at the right of every header for both even- and
odd-numbered pages:

     @headings off
     @everyheading @thischapter @| @thispage @| @today{}

You need to divide the left part from the central part and the central
part from the right part by inserting ‘@|’ between parts.  Otherwise,
the specification command will not be able to tell where the text for
one part ends and the next part begins.

   Each part can contain text or @-commands.  The text is printed as if
the part were within an ordinary paragraph in the body of the page.  The
@-commands replace themselves with the page number, date, chapter name,
or whatever.

   Here are the six heading and footing commands:

‘@everyheading LEFT @| CENTER @| RIGHT’
‘@everyfooting LEFT @| CENTER @| RIGHT’
     The 'every' commands specify the format for both even- and
     odd-numbered pages.  These commands are for documents that are
     printed on one side of each sheet of paper, or for documents in
     which you want symmetrical headers or footers.

‘@evenheading LEFT @| CENTER @| RIGHT’
‘@oddheading LEFT @| CENTER @| RIGHT’
‘@evenfooting LEFT @| CENTER @| RIGHT’
‘@oddfooting LEFT @| CENTER @| RIGHT’
     The 'even' and 'odd' commands specify the format for even-numbered
     pages and odd-numbered pages.  These commands are for books and
     manuals that are printed on both sides of each sheet of paper.

   Use the ‘@this...’ series of @-commands to provide the names of
chapters and sections and the page number.  You can use the ‘@this...’
commands in the left, center, or right portions of headers and footers.

   Here are the ‘@this...’ commands:

‘@thispage’
     Expands to the current page number.

‘@thissectionname’
     Expands to the name of the current section.

‘@thissectionnum’
     Expands to the number of the current section.

‘@thissection’
     Expands to the number and name of the current section, in the
     format 'Section 1: Title'.

‘@thischaptername’
     Expands to the name of the current chapter.

‘@thischapternum’
     Expands to the number of the current chapter, or letter of the
     current appendix.

‘@thischapter’
     Expands to the number and name of the current chapter, in the
     format 'Chapter 1: Title'.

‘@thistitle’
     Expands to the name of the document, as specified by the
     ‘@settitle’ command.

‘@thisfile’
     For ‘@include’ files only: expands to the name of the current
     ‘@include’ file.  If the current Texinfo source file is not an
     ‘@include’ file, this command has no effect.  This command does
     _not_ provide the name of the current Texinfo source file unless it
     is an ‘@include’ file.  (*Note Include Files::, for more
     information about ‘@include’ files.)

You can also use the ‘@today{}’ command, which expands to the current
date, in '1 Jan 1900' format.

   Other @-commands and text are printed in a header or footer just as
if they were in the body of a page.  It is useful to incorporate text,
particularly when you are writing drafts:

     @headings off
     @everyheading @emph{Draft!} @| @thispage @| @thischapter
     @everyfooting @| @| Version: 0.27: @today{}

   Beware of overlong titles: they may overlap another part of the
header or footer and blot it out.

   If you have very short chapters and/or sections, several of them can
appear on a single page.  You can specify which chapters and sections
you want ‘@thischapter’, ‘@thissection’ and other such macros to refer
to on such pages as follows:

‘@everyheadingmarks REF’
‘@everyfootingmarks REF’
     The REF argument can be either ‘top’ (the ‘@this...’ commands will
     refer to the chapter/section at the top of a page) or ‘bottom’ (the
     commands will reflect the situation at the bottom of a page).
     These ‘@every...’ commands specify what to do on both even- and
     odd-numbered pages.

‘@evenheadingmarks REF’
‘@oddheadingmarks REF’
‘@evenfootingmarks REF’
‘@oddfootingmarks REF’
     These ‘@even...’ and ‘@odd...’ commands specify what to do on only
     even- or odd-numbered pages, respectively.  The REF argument is the
     same as with the ‘@every...’ commands.

   Write these commands immediately after the ‘@...contents’ commands,
or after the ‘@end titlepage’ command if you don't have a table of
contents or if it is printed at the end of your manual.  These commands
have no effect in LaTeX.

   By default, for TeX, the ‘@this...’ commands reflect the situation at
the bottom of a page both in headings and in footings.

E.3 ‘@paragraphindent’: Controlling Paragraph Indentation
=========================================================

The Texinfo processors may insert whitespace at the beginning of the
first line of each paragraph, thereby indenting that paragraph.  You can
use the ‘@paragraphindent’ command to specify this indentation.  Write a
‘@paragraphindent’ command at the beginning of a line followed by either
‘asis’ or a number:

     @paragraphindent INDENT

   The indentation is according to the value of INDENT:

‘asis’
     Do not change the existing indentation (not implemented in printed
     output).

‘none’
0
     Omit all indentation.

N
     Indent by N space characters in Info output, by N ems in printed
     output.

   The default value of INDENT is 3.  ‘@paragraphindent’ is ignored for
HTML output.

   It is best to write the ‘@paragraphindent’ command before the
end-of-header line at the beginning of a Texinfo file, so the region
formatting commands indent paragraphs as specified.  *Note Start of
Header::.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: @firstparagraphindent,  Next: @exampleindent,  Prev: @paragraphindent,  Up: Global Document Commands

E.4 ‘@firstparagraphindent’: Indenting After Headings
=====================================================

As you can see in the present manual, the first paragraph in any section
is not indented by default.  Typographically, indentation is a paragraph
separator, which means that it is unnecessary when a new section begins.
This indentation is controlled with the ‘@firstparagraphindent’ command:

     @firstparagraphindent WORD

   The first paragraph after a heading is indented according to the
value of WORD:

‘none’
     Prevents the first paragraph from being indented (default).  This
     option is ignored by ‘makeinfo’ if ‘@paragraphindent asis’ is in
     effect.

‘insert’
     Include normal paragraph indentation.  This respects the paragraph
     indentation set by a ‘@paragraphindent’ command (*note
     @paragraphindent::).

   ‘@firstparagraphindent’ is ignored for HTML and DocBook output.

   It is best to write the ‘@firstparagraphindent’ command before the
end-of-header line at the beginning of a Texinfo file, so the region
formatting commands indent paragraphs as specified.  *Note Start of
Header::.

E.5 ‘@exampleindent’: Environment Indenting
===========================================

The Texinfo processors indent each line of ‘@example’ and similar
environments.  You can use the ‘@exampleindent’ command to specify this
indentation.  Write an ‘@exampleindent’ command at the beginning of a
line followed by either ‘asis’ or a number:

     @exampleindent INDENT

   The indentation is according to the value of INDENT:

‘asis’
     Do not change the existing indentation (not implemented in printed
     output).

0
     Omit all indentation.

N
     Indent environments by N space characters in Info output, by N ems
     in printed output.

   The default value of INDENT is 5 spaces in Info, and 0.4in in printed
output, which is somewhat less.  (The reduction is to help fit more
characters onto physical lines in printed manuals.)

   It is best to write the ‘@exampleindent’ command before the
end-of-header line at the beginning of a Texinfo file, so the region
formatting commands indent paragraphs as specified.  *Note Start of
Header::.

E.6 ‘@smallbook’: Printing "Small" Books
========================================

By default, TeX typesets pages for printing in an 8.5 by 11 inch format,
which is the "letter" size commonly used in the United States.  However,
you can direct TeX or LaTeX to typeset a document in a 7 by 9.25 inch
format that is suitable for bound books by inserting the following
command on a line by itself at the beginning of the Texinfo file, before
the title page:

     @smallbook

(Since many books are about 7 by 9.25 inches, this command might better
have been called the ‘@regularbooksize’ command, but it came to be
called the ‘@smallbook’ command by comparison to the 8.5 by 11 inch
format.)

   *Note Format with texi2dvi or texi2pdf::, and *note Preparing for
TeX::, for other ways to format with ‘@smallbook’ with TeX that do not
require changing the source file.

E.7 Printing on A4 Paper
========================

You can format a document for printing on ISO 216 A4 paper size with the
‘@afourpaper’ command.  Write the command on a line by itself near the
beginning of the Texinfo file, before the title page.

   You may or may not prefer the formatting that results from the
command ‘@afourlatex’.  There's also ‘@afourwide’ for A4 paper in wide
format, ‘@afivepaper’ for A5 paper, and ‘@bsixpaper’ for B6 paper.

   *Note Format with texi2dvi or texi2pdf:: and *note Preparing for
TeX::, for other ways to format for different paper sizes that do not
require changing the source file.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: @pagesizes,  Next: Microtypography,  Prev: A4 Paper,  Up: Global Document Commands

E.8 ‘@pagesizes’ [WIDTH][, HEIGHT]: Custom Page Sizes
=====================================================

You can explicitly specify the height and (optionally) width of the main
text area on the page with the ‘@pagesizes’ command.  Write this on a
line by itself near the beginning of the Texinfo file, before the title
page.  The height comes first, then the width if desired, separated by a
comma.  Examples:

     @pagesizes 200mm,150mm
and
     @pagesizes 11.5in

   This would be reasonable for printing on B5-size paper.  To
emphasize, this command specifies the size of the _text area_, not the
size of the paper (which is 250mm by 177mm for B5, 14in by 8.5in for
legal).

   To make more elaborate changes, such as changing any of the page
margins, you must define a new command in ‘texinfo.tex’ or
‘texinfo.cnf’.

   *Note Format with texi2dvi or texi2pdf::, and *note Preparing for
TeX::, for other ways to specify ‘@pagesizes’ that do not require
changing the source file.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: Microtypography,  Next: Magnification,  Prev: @pagesizes,  Up: Global Document Commands

E.9 Microtypography
===================

Some versions of TeX, namely pdfTeX and LuaTeX, have “microtypography”
features.  These involve stretching font glyphs slightly, and allowing
text to produce very slightly into the margins.  Use of these gives TeX
more flexibility in breaking a paragraph into lines, and can improve
paragraph appearance by reducing hyphenation and producing a more
consistent typographic color.

   ‘texinfo.tex’ uses these features ('microtype' for short) when
available.  You can turn microtype off by specifying ‘@microtype off’ in
your input file; likewise, ‘@microtype on’ turns microtype back on.

   The fonts used in LaTeX output may not be scalable.  If fonts are not
scalable, using microtypography could trigger an error when converting
the LaTeX output.  Therefore microtypography is not turned on in the
default case in LaTeX output.  It is possible to turn it on with
‘@microtype on’.  A way to get scalable fonts for the font used in the
default LaTeX output is to install the CM-Super font package
(<http://ctan.org/pkg/cm-super>).

   The ‘@microtype’ command does nothing for other output formats.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: Magnification,  Prev: Microtypography,  Up: Global Document Commands

E.10 Magnification
==================

You can attempt to direct TeX to typeset pages larger or smaller than
usual with the ‘\mag’ TeX command.  Everything that is typeset is scaled
proportionally larger or smaller.  (‘\mag’ stands for "magnification".)
This is _not_ a Texinfo @-command, but is a raw TeX command that is
prefixed with a backslash.  You have to write this command between
‘@tex’ and ‘@end tex’ (*note Raw Formatter Commands::).

   Follow the ‘\mag’ command with an ‘=’ and then a number that is 1000
times the magnification you desire.  For example, to print pages at 1.2
normal size, write the following near the beginning of the Texinfo file,
before the title page:

     @tex
     \global\mag=1200
     @end tex

   With some printing technologies, you can print normal-sized copies
that look better than usual by giving a larger-than-normal master to
your print shop.  They do the reduction, thus effectively increasing the
resolution.

   Depending on your system, DVI files prepared with a
nonstandard-‘\mag’ may not print or may print only with certain
magnifications.  Be prepared to experiment.

Appendix F Info Format Specification
************************************

Here we describe the technical details of the Info format.

   In this formal description, the characters ‘<>*()|=#’ are used for
the language of the description itself.  Other characters are literal.
The formal constructs used are typical: ‘<...>’ indicates a metavariable
name, ‘=’ means definition, ‘*’ repetition, ‘?’ optional, ‘()’ grouping,
‘|’ alternation, and ‘#’ comment.

   In general, programs that read Info files should try to be
case-insensitive to keywords that occur in the file (for example, ‘Tag
Table’ and ‘Tag table’ should be equivalent) in order to support
Info-generating programs that use different capitalization.

   We specify literal parentheses (those that are part of the Info
format) with <lparen> and <rparen>, meaning the single characters ‘(’
and ‘)’ respectively.  Finally, the two-character sequence ‘^X’ means
the single character ‘CTRL-X’, for any X.

   This format definition was written some 25 years after the Info
format was first devised.  So in the event of conflicts between this
definition and actual practice, practice wins.  It also assumes some
general knowledge of Texinfo; it is meant to be a guide for implementors
rather than a rigid technical standard.  We may refer back to other
parts of this manual for examples and definitions, rather than
redundantly spelling out every detail.

File: texinfo.info,  Node: Info Format Whole Manual,  Next: Info Format Preamble,  Up: Info Format Specification

F.1 Info Format: A Whole Manual
===============================

To begin, an Info manual is either “nonsplit” (contained wholly within a
single file) or “split” (across several files).

   The syntax for a nonsplit manual is:

         <nonsplit info file> =
     <preamble>
     <node>*
     <tag table>?
     <local variables>?

   When split, there is a “main file”, which contains only pointers to
the nodes given in other “subfiles”.  The main file looks like this:

         <split info main file> =
     <preamble>
     <indirect table>
     <tag table>
     <local variables>?

   The subfiles in a split manual have the following syntax:

         <split info subfile> =
     <preamble>
     <node>*

   Note that the tag table is not optional for split files, as it is
used with the indirect table to deduce which subfile a particular node
is in.

   Several of the sections in an Info file (such as nodes or tag tables)
begin with a sequence:

         <separator> = (^L)?^_(^L)?^J

That is, a ‘CTRL-_’ character followed by a newline, with optional
formfeed characters.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: Info Format Preamble,  Next: Info Format Indirect Table,  Prev: Info Format Whole Manual,  Up: Info Format Specification

F.2 Info Format: Preamble
=========================

The <preamble> is text at the beginning of all output files.  It is not
intended to be visible by default in an Info viewer, but may be
displayed upon user request.

         <preamble> =
     <identification>       # "This is FILENAME, produced by ..."
     <copying text>         # Expansion of @copying text.
     <dir entries>          # Derived from @dircategory and @direntry.

These pieces are:

<identification line>
     An arbitrary string beginning the output file, followed by a blank
     line.

<copying text>
     The expansion of a ‘@copying’ environment, if the manual has one
     (*note @copying::).

<dir entries>
     The result of any ‘@dircategory’ and ‘@direntry’ commands present
     in the manual (*note Installing Dir Entries::).


File: texinfo.info,  Node: Info Format Indirect Table,  Next: Info Format Tag Table,  Prev: Info Format Preamble,  Up: Info Format Specification

F.3 Info Format: Indirect Table
===============================

         <indirect table> =
     <separator>
     Indirect:
     (<filename>: <bytepos>)*

   The indirect table is written to the main file in the case of split
output only.  It specifies, as a decimal integer, the starting byte
position (zero-based) that the first node of each subfile would have if
the subfiles were concatenated together in order, not including the
top-level file.  The first node of actual content is pointed to by the
first entry.

   As an example, suppose split output is generated for the GDB manual.
The top-level file ‘gdb.info’ will contain something like this:

     <separator>
     Indirect:
     gdb.info-1: 1878
     gdb.info-2: 295733
     ...

   This tells Info viewers that the first node of the manual occurs at
byte 1878 of the file ‘gdb.info-1’ (which would be after that file's
preamble.)  The first node in the ‘gdb.info-2’ subfile would start at
byte 295733 if ‘gdb.info-2’ were appended to ‘gdb.info-1’, including any
preamble sections in both files.

   Unfortunately, Info-creating programs such as ‘makeinfo’ have not
always implemented these rules perfectly, due to various bugs and
oversights.  Therefore, robust Info viewers should fall back to
searching "nearby" the given position for a node, instead of giving up
immediately if the position is not exactly at a node beginning.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: Info Format Tag Table,  Next: Info Format Local Variables,  Prev: Info Format Indirect Table,  Up: Info Format Specification

F.4 Info Format: Tag Table
==========================

         <tag table> =
     <separator>
     Tag Table:
     (<lparen>Indirect<rparen>)?
     (Node|Ref): <nodeid>^?<bytepos>
     <separator>
     End Tag Table

   The ‘(Indirect)’ line appears in the case of split output only.

   The tag table specifies the starting byte position of each node and
anchor in the file.  In the case of split output, it is only written in
the main output file.

   Each line defines an identifier as either an anchor or a node, as
specified.  For example, ‘Node: Top^?1647’ says that the node named
‘Top’ starts at byte 1647 while ‘Ref: Overview-Footnote-1^?30045’ says
that the anchor named ‘Overview-Footnote-1’ starts at byte 30045.  It is
an error to define the same identifier both ways.

   In the case of nonsplit output, the byte positions simply refer to
the location in the output file.  In the case of split output, the byte
positions refer to an imaginary file created by concatenating all the
split files (but not the top-level file).  See the previous section.

   Here is an example:

     ^_
     Tag Table:
     Node: Top^?89
     Node: Ch1^?292
     ^_
     End Tag Table

This specifies a manual with two nodes, 'Top' and 'Ch1', at byte
positions 89 and 292 respectively.  Because the ‘(Indirect)’ line is not
present, the manual is not split.

   Preamble sections or other non-node sections of files do not have a
tag table entry.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: Info Format Local Variables,  Next: Info Format Regular Nodes,  Prev: Info Format Tag Table,  Up: Info Format Specification

F.5 Info Format: Local Variables
================================

The local variables section is optional and is currently used to give
the encoding information.  It may be augmented in the future.

         <local variables> =
     <separator>
     Local Variables:
     coding: <encoding>
     End:

   *Note @documentencoding::.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: Info Format Regular Nodes,  Next: Info Format Menu,  Prev: Info Format Local Variables,  Up: Info Format Specification

F.6 Info Format: Regular Nodes
==============================

Regular nodes look like this:

         <node> =
     <separator>
     File: <fn>, Node: <id1>, (Next: <id2>, )? (Prev: <id3>, )? Up: <id4>

     <general text, until the next ^_ or end-of-file>

At least one space or tab must be present after each colon and comma,
but any number of spaces are ignored.  The <id> node identifiers have
following format:

        <id> = (<lparen><infofile><rparen>)?<node-spec>?
        <node-spec> = <nodename> | <del><nodename><del>
        <del> = ^?

   This <node> defines <id1> in file <fn>, which is typically either
‘manualname’ or ‘manualname.info’.  No parenthesized <infofile>
component may appear within <id1>.

   Each of the identifiers after ‘Next’, ‘Prev’ and ‘Up’ refer to nodes
or anchors within a file.  These pointers normally refer within the same
file, but ‘(dir)’ is often used to point to the top-level dir file.  If
an <infofile> component is used then the node name may be omitted, in
which case the node identifier refers to the ‘Top’ node within the
referenced file.

   The ‘Next’ and ‘Prev’ pointers are optional.  The ‘Up’ pointer is
technically also optional, although most likely this indicates a mistake
in the node structuring.  Conventionally, the nodes are arranged to form
a tree, but this is not a requirement of the format.

   Node names containing periods, commas, colons or parentheses can
confuse Info readers.  If it is necessary to refer to a node whose name
contains any of these, the <nodename> should be surrounded by a pair of
‘DEL’ characters (‘CTRL-?’, character number 127).  ‘makeinfo’ adds
these characters when needed in the default case.  Note that not all
Info readers recognize this syntax.  *Note Info Node Names
Constraints::.

   The <general text> of the node can include the special constructs
described next.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: Info Format Menu,  Next: Info Format Image,  Prev: Info Format Regular Nodes,  Up: Info Format Specification

F.7 Info Format: Menu
=====================

Conventionally menus appear at the end of nodes, but the Info format
places no restrictions on their location.

         <menu> =
     * Menu:
     (<menu entry> | <menu comment>)*

   The parts of a <menu entry> are also described in *note Menu Parts::.
They have the same syntax as cross-references, with a leading ‘*’
instead of ‘* (N|n)ote’ (*note Info Format Cross Reference::).  Indices
extend the menu format to specify the destination line; *note Info
Format Printindex::.

   A <menu comment> is any line not beginning with ‘*’ that appears
either at the beginning of the menu or is separated from a menu entry by
one or more blank lines.  These comments are intended to be displayed as
part of the menu, as-is (*note Writing a Menu::).


File: texinfo.info,  Node: Info Format Image,  Next: Info Format Printindex,  Prev: Info Format Menu,  Up: Info Format Specification

F.8 Info Format: Image
======================

The ‘@image’ command results in the following special directive within
the Info file (*note Images::):

         <image> =
     ^@^H[image src="<image file>"
                 (text="<txt file contents>")?
                 (alt="<alt text>")?
     ^@^H]

   The line breaks and indentation in this description are editorial;
the whitespace between the different parts of the directive in Info
files is arbitrary.

   In the strings <image file>, <txt file contents> and <alt text>, ‘"’
is quoted as ‘\"’ and ‘\’ is quoted as ‘\\’.  The txt and alt
specifications are optional.

   The alt value serves the same purpose as in HTML: A prose description
of the image.  In text-only displays or speech systems, for example, the
alt value may be used instead of displaying the (typically graphical)
<image file>.

   The <txt file contents>, if present, should be taken as an ASCII
representation of the image, for possible use on a text-only display.

   The format does not prescribe the choice between displaying the
<image file>, the <alt text> or the <txt file contents>.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: Info Format Printindex,  Next: Info Format Cross Reference,  Prev: Info Format Image,  Up: Info Format Specification

F.9 Info Format: Printindex
===========================

An index in Info format is a kind of menu, with an additional directive
at the beginning to mark it as an index menu.

         <printindex> =
     ^@^H[index^@^H]
     * Menu:

     <index entry>*

   The <index entry> items are similar to normal menu entries, but the
free-format description is replaced by the line number of where the
entries occurs in the text:

         <index entry> =
     * <entry text>: <node-spec>. <line-spec>

         <line-spec> =
     <lparen>line <lineno><rparen>

   The initial part, ‘<entry text>: <entry node>.’, should be on a
single line.  The <entry text> is the index term.

   Even though <entry text> is followed by a colon, it may itself
contain colons, so Info readers should try to include as much of the
line as possible in the <entry text>.  (However, <entry text> may not
contain the ‘DEL’ characters that may occur in <node-spec>.)

   <lineno> is an unsigned integer, given relative to the start of the
<entry node>.  An optional line break may occur before ‘<line-spec>’.

   Here is an example:

     ^@^H[index^@^H]
     * Menu:

     * thunder:           Weather Phenomena.             (line 5)

   This means that an index entry for 'thunder' appears at line 5 of the
node 'Weather Phenomena'.


File: texinfo.info,  Node: Info Format Cross Reference,  Prev: Info Format Printindex,  Up: Info Format Specification

F.10 Info Format: Cross-reference
=================================

A general cross-reference in Info format has one of the following two
forms:

         <cross-reference> =
       * (N|n)ote <id>::
     | * (N|n)ote <label>:<id>(.|,)

         <id> = (<lparen><infofile><rparen>)?<node-spec>?
         <label> = <label text> | <del><label text><del>

   No space should occur between the ‘*’ character and the following ‘N’
or ‘n’.  ‘*Note’ should be used at the start of a sentence, otherwise
‘*note’ should be used.  (Some Info readers, such as the one in Emacs,
can display ‘*Note’ and ‘*note’ as ‘See’ and ‘see’ respectively.)  In
both cases, <label text> is descriptive text.

   In both forms the <id> refers to a node or anchor, in the same way as
a reference in the node information line does (*note Info Format Regular
Nodes::).  The optional parenthesized ‘<infofile>’ is the name of the
manual being referenced, and <node-spec> gives the node or anchor within
that manual.

   The second form has a descriptive label.  A cross-reference in this
form should usually be terminated with a comma or period, to make it
feasible to find the end of the <id>.

   If <label> contains a colon character (:), it should be surrounded
with a pair of <del> characters.  Likewise, quoting characters may be
used for the node name if it contains problematic characters; then a
terminating comma or period is not needed.  As stated earlier, this
quoting mechanism is not supported in all Info-reading programs.

   The format does not prescribe how to find other manuals to resolve
such references.

   Here are some examples:

     *note GNU Free Documentation License::
     *note Tag table: Info Format Tag Table, for details.
     *Note Overview: (make)Top.
     *Note ^?:^?: (bash)Bourne Shell Builtins.
     *Note alloca.h: (gnulib)^?alloca.h^?.

   The first shows a reference to a node in the current manual using the
short form.

   The second also refers to a node in the current manual, namely 'Info
Format Tag Table'; the 'Tag table' before the ‘:’ is only a label on
this particular reference, and the ‘for details.’ is text belonging to
the sentence, not part of the reference.

   The third example refers to the node 'Top' in another manual, namely
‘make’, with 'Overview' being the label for this cross-reference.

   The fourth example shows a colon character being quoted in a label,
and the fifth example shows a period being quoted in a node name.

   *Note Cross References::.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document “free” in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.  We
     recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can
     be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You accept
     the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way
     requiring permission under copyright law.

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the
     notice that says that the Document is released under this License.
     If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it
     is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may
     contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify
     any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed
     of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely
     available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text
     formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats
     suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise
     Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has
     been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by
     readers is not Transparent.  An image format is not Transparent if
     used for any substantial amount of text.  A copy that is not
     "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming
     simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.
     Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.
     Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and
     edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which
     the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and
     the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
     processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies
     of the Document to the public.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)
     To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the
     conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the title
     equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material on the
     covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the covers, as
     long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these
     conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
     Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with
     each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general
     network-using public has access to download using public-standard
     network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free
     of added material.  If you use the latter option, you must take
     reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque
     copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will
     remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
     year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or
     through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies,
     to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
     Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the
     Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing
     distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever
     possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these things in
     the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous
          versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the
          History section of the Document).  You may use the same title
          as a previous version if the original publisher of that
          version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the
          Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History" in the
          Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and
          publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add
          an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the
          previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in the
          "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a work
          that was published at least four years before the Document
          itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers
          to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section
          all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered
          in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers or the
          equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate
     some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their
     titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's
     license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any other
     section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of
     the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage
     of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
     through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document
     already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added
     by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on
     behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old
     one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added
     the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all
     of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents
     in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
     License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
     document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a
     storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void,
     and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
     finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you
     under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not
     permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the
     same material does not give you any rights to use it.

  10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the
     Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may
     choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free
     Software Foundation.  If the Document specifies that a proxy can
     decide which future versions of this License can be used, that
     proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

  11. RELICENSING

     "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any
     World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
     provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
     public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.
     A "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the
     site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
     site.

     "CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
     license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
     corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
     California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
     published by that same organization.

     "Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
     in part, as part of another Document.

     An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this
     License, and if all works that were first published under this
     License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently
     incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover
     texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior
     to November 1, 2008.

     The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the
     site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1,
     2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the "with...Texts." line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free
software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit
their use in free software.
