# Goals and features

**libdvdread** is a library for simpler navigation (DVDs without menus)

## Where does it come from?

This library is based on a lot of code and expertise from the **Ogle project**.
**Ogle** was the first DVD player who implemented **free DVD navigation**. The
**libdvdread** developers wish to express their gratitude to the Ogle people
for all the valuable research work they have done.

Initially, the dvdnav code was part of a plugin to the xine media player
called xine-dvdnav. Later on, the DVD VM specific code was split
from xine-dvdnav and went into the first version of libdvdnav.

Then, it was forked, and forked again on MPlayer repositories.
libdvdnav and libdvdread were merged, and then split again.

## Where is it now?
